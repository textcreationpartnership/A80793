         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>To the Learned Doctor</hi> H. HAMMOND, <hi>Health.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SIR, whoſoever I am, is not much materiall to know. I humbly beg your Pardon for intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with your Quarrell, without your <hi>Privity</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which you, of all men, are beſt able to maintain without <hi>Abettors</hi> or <hi>Aſsiſtants.</hi> And I hope you will look upon it onely as an <hi>Errour</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> that I ſhould preſume to anſwer that Pamphlet, which your ſelf had ſo ſeverely condemned to <hi>Neglect,</hi> and reſolved to confute onely by your learned <hi>Silence.</hi> For all the world knows how ſpeedily you could, if you pleaſed in ſo juſt a Cauſe as this, have ſet forth a <hi>Rejoynder,</hi> becauſe you have already ſo ſoon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered far abler <hi>Adverſaries</hi> then this <hi>Refuter,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Opinion himſelf and his Friends have of his <hi>Scholaſticall</hi> Abilities.</p>
            <p>Indeed it was my deſire, and in my own Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it would have been more for my intereſt and quiet, if I had been <hi>ſilent,</hi> or at moſt ſerved onely
<pb facs="tcp:119243:3"/> as an <hi>under-workman</hi> to have fitted and prepared Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls for an abler Artiſt to have raiſed a more laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Monument and <hi>Obelisck</hi> to your Name and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. And ſo conſcious I am to mine own Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and inabilities to endure the <hi>Wind</hi> and <hi>Sun,</hi> and ſo little thoughts I had, when I firſt ſet upon this Buſineſs, of doing any thing for the <hi>Publick,</hi> that now all is finiſhed and expoſed to the world, I cannot but wonder that it could be drawn from my <hi>Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> to run ſo hazardous a Courſe. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I may be <hi>concealed,</hi> yet I cannot but fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently bluſh at the many Cenſures that will paſs upon the <hi>Unknown</hi> Author, though no man ſpeaks, or thinks of me.</p>
            <p>But now ſuch as it is, I humbly throw it at your feet, not for <hi>approbation</hi> and <hi>applauſe,</hi> but for <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>patronage.</hi> It has nothing to commend it but the <hi>chearfulneſs</hi> of the Oblation. It is no ambitious nor covetous Exhalation, but a perfect <hi>Nidabah</hi> and Free will offering of Love. And ſuch I doubt not will be acceptable. It was this alone that made the poor Widows two <hi>mites</hi> a richer preſent to the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> then the Gold and Silver <hi>talents</hi> of the more wealthy but leſs willing Votaries: and the very Heathens could ſmell, that one <hi>grain</hi> of this <hi>Incenſe</hi> made a ſweeter Perfume in the noſtrills of their gods, then the greateſt <hi>clouds</hi> of ſmoak that aroſe from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Hecatombs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you well may wonder how a Defence of <hi>two ſheets</hi> ſhould ſwell into ſuch a <hi>Volume,</hi> and what ſtrange <hi>over-ruling Influence</hi> ſhould raiſe a <hi>Cloud</hi> of a <hi>hand-breadth</hi> to <hi>fill</hi> and <hi>overſpread</hi> the whole face of <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:119243:3"/>
            <p> And the very truth is, Sir, I my ſelf am much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed at the <hi>Bulk,</hi> now all is finiſhed. But I ſhall give you my <hi>Reaſons,</hi> that made the work to <hi>enlarge</hi> thus <hi>inſenſibly</hi> under my hands.</p>
            <p>Sir, you have an <hi>Adverſary</hi> more <hi>Confident</hi> then ſtrong; one that (as I could tell you from credible information) does not only <hi>Publickly</hi> brag that he has made you a <hi>Dunce,</hi> but in every Sermon almoſt of note that he makes has one <hi>Uſe of Confutation againſt the learned D. Hammond:</hi> Nay that his ordinary <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey</hi> Lectures, and <hi>Homilies</hi> to the People are full of ſuch <hi>Ovations,</hi> and not the <hi>meaneſt Pulpit</hi> round about him, but has been turned into a <hi>Divinity Chair,</hi> where <hi>Profeſſor-</hi>like, he has diſciplined, and arraigned, and condemned you in a <hi>Scholaſticall</hi> way.</p>
            <p>But I inſiſt not on <hi>Report,</hi> it is his <hi>Pamphlet</hi> I fix on. That you, and the world may ſee, I do not wrong him (eſpecially becauſe he <note n="†" place="margin">It is my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to have fair wars with you, and my Pen ſhall not drop a diſreſpective ſyllable of you. pag. 17.

            <p>Firſt then, in a <hi>Sarcaſticall Irony</hi> and Jeer, he calls you <hi>great Critick,</hi> that is in plain Terms, an empty whiffling <hi>Grammarian,</hi> and ſayes, <hi>he is</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Pag. 10.</note> 
               <hi>loth to enter into a Conteſt with ſo great a Critick,</hi> as your ſelf, <hi>touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the meaning of a word.</hi> And what is it? The poor Engliſh Monoſyllable, <hi>Mince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then in the very ſame Section he ranks you among the number of thoſe <note n="b" place="margin">Pag. 10.</note> 
               <hi>erroneous Perſons</hi> (no leſs then <hi>Hereticks</hi> without doubt) <hi>that in the firſt broaching of</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Next he tells you (and in the very ſame breath where he profeſſes Reſpect) that he is <note n="c" place="margin">pag. 17.</note> 
               <hi>reſolved to ſwallow none of your Proofleſs dictates;</hi> and that <note n="d" place="margin">pag. 15.</note> 
               <hi>you muſt pardon him if he entertain not your vehement Aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verations, as ſolid Arguments, as if they were</hi> Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones per ſe notae.</p>
            <p>But he has hitherto uſed you kindly. For in another place in plain terms he <hi>challenges</hi> you <note n="e" place="margin">pag. 19.</note> 
               <hi>to ſhew any thing for the juſtification of your Tenent from any Schoolman to be had in</hi> Pauls-Churchyard, <hi>or at leaſt in the Library at</hi> Oxford, the great <hi>Bodleys</hi> Library.</p>
            <p>And as if this had been too little, again he tells the world, that he is <note n="f" place="margin">pag 37.</note>

            <p>And then (for a cloſe) he declares in his very <hi>Title Page</hi> that he <hi>has proved it to be utterly irreconcilable with the</hi> 1. <hi>Fullneſs of Chriſts Habituall Grace.</hi> 2. <hi>The Perpetuall Happineſs, and</hi> 3. <hi>the Impeccability of his Soul.</hi>

            <p>I confeſs at firſt reading I was troubled at <hi>this uſage:</hi> but ſince I ſee it is the <hi>Mode</hi> of confuting D. <hi>Hammond.</hi> And therefore finding the Adverſary <hi>Confident</hi> and <hi>Scornfull</hi> but withall very <hi>weak,</hi> I reſolved to diſplay both his Ignorance and Folly to the view of all, even the meaneſt ſpectators. Nor could I in Juſtice do leſs to one, that had ſo unworthily handled you, without any <hi>Provocation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed what courſe was elſe to be taken to anſwer ſuch ſevere, but uningenuous <hi>Criminations?</hi> Should I onely have <hi>tamely</hi> replyed, that I had well weighed your Reaſons and conſidered his Replyes, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conſulted the Authors he referrs to, and had found he was miſtaken, and ſo left him to a further
<pb facs="tcp:119243:5"/> Proof and Confirmation of his <hi>Objections?</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that this had been a very <hi>ſhort</hi> way, and <hi>ſatisfactory</hi> enough. For by the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Diſputation,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more is required of the <hi>Reſpondent</hi> but to <hi>deny,</hi> or <hi>diſtinguiſh,</hi> where he ſees cauſe, or elſe plainly to <hi>grant</hi> the <hi>Argument:</hi> and the <hi>Opponent</hi> (whoſe place your <hi>Refuter</hi> evidently ſuſtains) is bound to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute his <hi>Objection,</hi> till he make the <hi>Defendent</hi> to <hi>yield</hi> to the force of his <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or by <hi>Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to ſhew that it concerns not the <hi>Queſtion.</hi> But then withall I conſidered, that if I ſhould have taken this courſe, I ſhould have ſaid little, to the greateſt part of Readers in your <hi>Apologie</hi> and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>For firſt, I ſaw that his Reply was Printed (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with <hi>Licence</hi> and <hi>Approbation</hi> of the preſent <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity)</hi> at <hi>Oxford.</hi> And then ſecondly, I underſtood that he had many Admirers, eſpecially among Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Divines, and young Students, for his skil in <hi>Schoole-learning</hi> now a ſtranger among us. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I conſidered, that he being a writer of tall Name, and ſtrong repute among many, I ſhould have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing but <hi>contempt</hi> among them, for ſuch An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers; and that the <hi>Denyall</hi> of a <hi>Nameleſs</hi> Author, without Credit, and without Fame, would not at all have <hi>Ballanced</hi> againſt the weight of ſo <hi>valued</hi> a <hi>Schoolman.</hi> But laſtly, which moſt moved me, I was not ignorant, that as the Books he referrs to, were very rarely to be had, eſpecially in Private Studies, ſo even thoſe, that had them, would rather have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved his <hi>ſuggeſtions,</hi> againſt mine, then put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Trouble and Expence of <hi>conſulting</hi> and <hi>peruſall</hi> of Authors, to umpire the difference. And
<pb facs="tcp:119243:5"/> therefore I judged it neceſſary for the Readers ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and the full defence of that Truth you maintain, to lay down the Authors words at large, and clearly thence prove either his <hi>prevaricating</hi> or <hi>miſtakes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is one main Reaſon of the increaſe of the Bulk.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Motive that drew me to this length, was my unwillingneſs altogether to ſpend time in the <hi>unprofitable</hi> diſcoveries of an other man's <hi>errours,</hi> but I rather deſired to be <hi>didacticall</hi> and <hi>inſtructive.</hi> And therefore where I ſaw reaſon, and the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was profitable and materiall, I let my pen run beyond the ordinary limits of an <hi>elenchticall</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. And becauſe I ſaw little or nothing as yet ſaid on either ſide, to explain the nature of that <hi>ardency</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> which was the <hi>ſubject matter</hi> of the Diſpute, I reſolved, as occaſion offered, to ſtate it as clearly, as I could, and to my poor abilities o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the true nature of it, that ſo the Reader might be ſatisfied in the buſineſs of the Controverſie, and not altogether loſe his <hi>proſpect</hi> after the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the <hi>clouds</hi> and <hi>ſmoke</hi> of <hi>contention,</hi> but aſwell diſcover the full <hi>lineaments</hi> and <hi>pourtraicture</hi> of that <hi>truth,</hi> you maintain, as the <hi>miſtakes</hi> of your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, and his falſe <hi>ſhapes</hi> and <hi>phantaſms</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>A third Reaſon was becauſe I found your <hi>Refuter,</hi> having upon the matter done with your <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, fall to oppoſe your Doctrine in groſs, by Arguments drawn from the <hi>fullneſs</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>Chriſts habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall grace,</hi> his <hi>perpetuall</hi> uninterrupted <hi>happineſs</hi> and <hi>impeccability,</hi> and from thence had largely <hi>digreſſed</hi> to cenſure a paſſage in your Treatiſe of <hi>Will-worſhip,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:119243:6"/> about the ſenſe of the <hi>firſt</hi> and great <hi>Commandment</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> and this I muſt confeſs made me willing to <hi>amplifie</hi> and <hi>digreſs,</hi> as well as he. Nor have I onely contented my ſelf to anſwer his Arguments, and acquit and vindicate your Doctrine from the <hi>coarſe aſperſions</hi> thrown upon it of <hi>Popiſhly affected,</hi> but in a <hi>Scholaſticall</hi> way have treated of the <hi>Themes</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as well as diſcovered the <hi>groſs ignorance</hi> of your Adverſary. And becauſe his diſcourſe lead me to conſider thoſe <hi>high</hi> and noble <hi>Themes</hi> of the <hi>Love of God,</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> both <hi>Legall</hi> and <hi>Evangelicall,</hi> as alſo <hi>Chriſts</hi> two fold ſtate of <hi>Comprehenſor</hi> and <hi>Viator,</hi> I was willing to treat of them with that Induſtry and care, as ſo weighty Arguments deſerved, and have as well <hi>Didactically</hi> as <hi>Eriſtically</hi> conſidered them. And withall upon occaſion where M. <hi>Jeanes</hi> and M. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> did agree upon the ſame common principles of oppoſition to you, I have (though contrary to my firſt deſign and aim) fallen upon a vindication of ſome paſſages in your Tract of <hi>Will-worſhip,</hi> which M. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> and he had cenſured, and upon that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion alſo I have cleared and confirmed diverſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in your <hi>Account</hi> to the <hi>Triplex Diatribe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then, which is the laſt great Reaſon of the bulk of this Diſcourſe, I have taken occaſion to prove the <hi>Invariability,</hi> of <hi>Gods love,</hi> and to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that it is no changeable <hi>tranſcendent quality,</hi> but one immutable and <hi>ſubſtantiall act</hi> againſt <hi>Crellius</hi> and the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and yet withall declare how God not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, is, and may be ſaid to love ſome more, and ſome leſs. I have ſpoken alſo of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Habits,</hi> in order to that <hi>habituall</hi> and <hi>actuall</hi> love of Chriſt the main buſineſs of the
<pb facs="tcp:119243:6"/> 
               <hi>Controverſie;</hi> I have proved and confirmed the <hi>full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of <hi>Chriſts habituall grace;</hi> I have treated of his <hi>merits,</hi> and the <hi>nature</hi> of his <hi>ſufferings,</hi> and the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of them in his bloody <hi>agony;</hi> of his twofold <hi>will;</hi> and how as <hi>God-man</hi> he was in capacity to <hi>pray;</hi> of his <hi>ardency</hi> in <hi>prayer,</hi> and how he might <hi>earneſtly deſire</hi> a <hi>removall</hi> of that <hi>cup,</hi> which yet he <hi>came to drink off.</hi> I have treated alſo of the ſeverall kinds of <hi>love</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, as <hi>viator</hi> and <hi>comprehenſor;</hi> of his <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>hope,</hi> and <hi>truſt</hi> in God, and ſhewed what <hi>love</hi> of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence</hi> and <hi>complacency</hi> in him was capable of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,</hi> and how all theſe are different from <hi>ardency</hi> in <hi>Prayer.</hi> I have alſo taken occaſion in order to M. <hi>Caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drey</hi> but with ſome reflexions on M. <hi>Jeanes</hi> to treat of <hi>counſels Evangelicall,</hi> and <hi>Goſpel-freewill-offerings,</hi> of <hi>perfection of life</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>ſtate,</hi> of works of <hi>ſupererogation,</hi> to ſpeak of <hi>originall ſin,</hi> and the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in it; of Man's threefold ſtate; of <hi>growth</hi> in <hi>grace;</hi> of <hi>different degrees</hi> in <hi>glory;</hi> of the <hi>inequality</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels love of God</hi> in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and of <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſſibility of <hi>proficiency</hi> in <hi>grace</hi> in the ſtate of Innocence; of <hi>lukewarmneſs</hi> and <hi>ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi> of <hi>juſtification,</hi> and of the <hi>difference</hi> of the two <hi>Covenants,</hi> and Mans ſeverall <hi>obligation</hi> under them, with other points of this nature, together with ſome <hi>Metaphyſicall</hi> and <hi>Philoſophicall</hi> notions interſperſed. All which as they are <hi>themes</hi> of high <hi>nature,</hi> and would not admit of a running diſcourſe, ſo they are not altogether <hi>digreſſions</hi> from the main Argument, eſpecially in order to the <hi>Refuters</hi> manner of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that in many parts required it. And becauſethe Reader will not ordinarily meet with ſuch <hi>arguments</hi> treated on in our <hi>language,</hi> eſpecially in a <hi>Scholaſtical</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:119243:7"/> way, I was willing to gratifie him in them, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of my power. And if he be offended with this my <hi>labour</hi> of <hi>love,</hi> and too <hi>officious</hi> deſire to <hi>pleaſe</hi> him, I here promiſe before you, that if he <hi>pardon</hi> me this <hi>once,</hi> he ſhall not have occaſion to blame me for a ſecond-ſuch-offence.</p>
            <p>And now having given you the true Reaſons of the <hi>length</hi> of this Diſcourſe, it will be fit I alſo make you ſome account of my <hi>ſtile,</hi> and my manner of handling it.</p>
            <p>As then your <hi>Refuter</hi> every where pretends to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi> and the <hi>Schools,</hi> ſo fit it was I ſhould treat him in a <hi>Scholaſticall</hi> way and in writings of this kind: The beſt <hi>ornament</hi> ariſes from the <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> of the <hi>diſcourſe,</hi> and he is moſt <hi>eloquent,</hi> that can expreſs his matter <hi>cleareſt,</hi> and make ſuch <hi>knotty</hi> ſtuff <hi>plain.</hi> I have ſeen the <hi>ſtatue</hi> of a <hi>Roman Gladiator</hi> pourtrayed <hi>naked,</hi> and as combating his enemy in the midſt of the <hi>Amphitheater.</hi> And it was a piece of high worth, and curious art, and more rich in the lively repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the wrathfulneſs of the look, the ſtretched and well ſet muſcles, the ſtrong and brawny parts, and the vigour and agility of the limbs, then if he had been carved in the <hi>robes</hi> of a <hi>Senator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore ſince my work was for <hi>argument</hi> and <hi>defence,</hi> I choſe to build my Fabrick not <hi>curious,</hi> but <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and becauſe much of my materials were of <hi>marble,</hi> I laboured onely to <hi>poliſh,</hi> not to <hi>paint</hi> it. And this is the <hi>genuine</hi> true beauty, that ſprings from the naturall <hi>compactedneſs,</hi> and <hi>ſolidity</hi> of the <hi>ſtone;</hi> and he that ſtrives to trim it with <hi>painting,</hi> though of gold and vermilion, doth but <hi>hide,</hi> not <hi>adorn</hi> it. Such embelliſhments are onely fit for leſs <hi>ſolid</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials.
<pb facs="tcp:119243:7"/> And therefore, Sir, as I cannot tempt my Reader, or beguile his patience to the end of the diſcourſe, with artificiall expreſſions, and curious conceits, and lively flaſhes of wit: ſo I muſt tell him that if he look for <hi>colours,</hi> and <hi>varniſh</hi> and <hi>elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi> he muſt not ſeek after <hi>Architects</hi> and <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> but <hi>Limners</hi> and <hi>Romances.</hi> For though Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broderies and lace, rich jewels, and curled treſſes, are the <hi>uſuall ornaments</hi> of <hi>brides,</hi> yet they are as <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome,</hi> and commonly ſuſpected as <hi>meretricious</hi> in <hi>matrons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I care not then for <hi>neatneſs,</hi> if you, that are beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, judge me <hi>ſolid</hi> and <hi>ſtrong.</hi> And I doubt not but the knowing Reader will be better contented with the plain <hi>demonſtration</hi> and proof of a <hi>concluſion,</hi> then if I had written in a ſtrain of the <hi>declamations</hi> of <hi>Quintilian</hi> and <hi>Seneca's controverſies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet Sir, becauſe the age is more for <hi>phanſie</hi> then reaſon, and better pleaſed with <hi>fine</hi> and <hi>aery</hi> diſcourſes, then with <hi>ſolid</hi> and <hi>plain,</hi> and becauſe I have known ſome exquiſite <hi>Architects</hi> that have been curious <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> too, I was willing, where the matter would bear, and needed rather <hi>illuſtration</hi> then <hi>proof,</hi> to let my phanſie take wing, and to range and ſore about like a <hi>haggard Hawke,</hi> that in a Sunſhine day more minds her <hi>weathering</hi> then her <hi>prey.</hi> And willing I was, though in the middeſt of the <hi>Schools</hi> not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <hi>ſevere,</hi> but amidſt buſineſs and reaſon to yield a little to the <hi>garbe</hi> and <hi>mode</hi> of the age, and to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the <hi>Printer</hi> ſo far, as to let the world ſee, that where my expreſſions are <hi>plain,</hi> and after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Schools,</hi> it aroſe not altogether from bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs of wit, and a lowneſs of expreſſion, but ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and choice.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:119243:8"/>
            <p> And for this as I have the authority of a great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of wit and method at <hi>Rome:</hi> ſo I have ſeen in noble buildings, where the foundation has been of rough and ſolid ſtone, and the pillars of marble, and the walls of plain <hi>Aſhler,</hi> yet the <hi>Pillaſters</hi> and <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls,</hi> and the <hi>Architraves</hi> and <hi>Freezes,</hi> that bear no ſtreſs in the building, have been artificially carved.</p>
            <p>And now having ſaid this, Sir, I have but onely told you my <hi>deſign</hi> and <hi>platform,</hi> I ſpeak not of my <hi>performance.</hi> That were a piece of vanity unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. This was onely in <hi>Idea,</hi> in my <hi>proſpect</hi> and <hi>aim,</hi> and what I deſired to accompliſh and perfect, when I undertook your defence. For I thought you deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the beſt <hi>Apology</hi> could be writ, which (pardon me your modeſty, if I ſay) none can make but Doctor <hi>Hammond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I have done any thing in order to the vindication of the <hi>truth</hi> and you, I have then my ambition, and all the <hi>reward</hi> that I deſire is, that you will not <hi>enquire</hi> after me, nor <hi>ask</hi> after my <hi>name.</hi> But if you and the Reader ſhall find nothing in me to content you, then inflict upon me the <hi>worſt cenſure,</hi> that can befall a <hi>bad Author,</hi> and <hi>enquire</hi> not at all after me, but let me be <hi>forgotten,</hi> and thought <hi>unworthy</hi> of a <hi>name.</hi> Whether then you <hi>approve</hi> or <hi>condemn,</hi> I have my <hi>ſole aim,</hi> if I continue <hi>unknown.</hi>

            <p>THou art to be advertiſed of three things. The firſt is, that though the Author be aſſured, that things once <hi>well</hi> done, are alwayes done <hi>ſoon,</hi> and that the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merocallis</hi> though a very fair flower, is as born, ſo alſo dead and faded the ſame day, and therefore cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to any applauſe or commendations for the quickneſs of his <hi>diſpatch,</hi> yet leſt M. <hi>Jeanes</hi> or his admirers ſhould think his <hi>reply</hi> to Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> a ſtrong and ſtiff work that requires ſo <hi>large</hi> and <hi>ſtudied</hi> an anſwer, and ſuch <hi>delay</hi> in the <hi>publication,</hi> I am to acquaint thee, that this work was begun, except the firſt <hi>eſſay,</hi> about <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſontide</hi> 1657, and finiſhed as it is (ſome few <hi>quotations</hi> and ſmall <hi>alterations</hi> and <hi>additions</hi> excepted) and brought up to the <hi>Printer</hi> that <hi>Michaelmas term</hi> following, and that it had been committed to the Preſs very ſhortly after, but that the firſt and onely draught was through the haſte of the Author, and the badneſs of his quick and running hand in many places ſo obſcure, and illegible, that it was juſtly conceived the <hi>Compoſitor</hi> would be very much
<pb facs="tcp:119243:9"/> miſtaken in the ſetting, which faults by the <hi>Ordinary Overſeer</hi> of the <hi>Preſs</hi> could not eaſily and to the ſenſe of the <hi>Author</hi> be amended. And therefore by reaſon of the Authors great diſtance from <hi>London</hi> and the difficulty of <hi>returns</hi> upon the conſulting doubts and amendments, it was deſired that the copy might be fair written before it was attempted. This ſo reaſonable a requeſt, could not but be very eaſily aſſented to, and though it was ſpeedily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, yet a fit <hi>Amanuenſis,</hi> of whoſe fidelity the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor could be confident, was not preſently thought on. And when that was done, by reaſon of the Authors diſtance from him, and his many neceſſary employments, the <hi>tranſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> went on ſo ſlowly, that a great deal more time was ſpent in the new writing, then was in the firſt draught. So that in the mean while, the <hi>Stationer</hi> being ingaged in other buſineſſes, not very ſuddenly to be diſpatched, this was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſtay its turn. For it is with Writers for the <hi>Preſs,</hi> as with <hi>Water-men</hi> at the <hi>Thames,</hi> both muſt ſtay till their <hi>courſe,</hi> unleſs the Author be well known, and the world has experience of his worth to encourage the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chand-Libraires</hi> to an extraordinary undertaking, which could not here be expected, where the Author for reaſons beſt known to himſelf, was ſo reſolved on his <hi>concealment,</hi> that neither the <hi>Doctor</hi> nor the <hi>Printer</hi> himſelf ſhould eaſily come to know him. And this is the true cauſe that it comes out ſo late, and when the <hi>Controverſie</hi> is almoſt forgotten, although it was done ſo ſoon, and in ſo ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a time.</p>
            <p>The ſecond concerns not the Learned, but the common Engliſh Reader. And that is to let him know, that he need not much be troubled at the long <hi>quotations</hi> in <hi>Latine</hi> not rendred into <hi>Engliſh.</hi> For ſuch a work was conceaved alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether needleſs for him, becauſe as they are produced onely
<pb facs="tcp:119243:9"/> in order to M. <hi>Jeanes,</hi> and the Readers, that could eaſily underſtand them, ſo the full ſenſe and meaning of them was every where given in ſhort. And therefore the <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> of them would very needleſly have ſwelled the work to a greater Bulk, that was too unweildy already.</p>
            <p>The third concerns M. <hi>Cawdrey.</hi> And for this know you muſt, that the Author, when he firſt undertook Maſter <hi>Jeanes</hi> had no deſign or thoughts at all of him. But in the proceſs of the work being forced to have frequent recourſe to the <hi>Doctors Account</hi> he could not in juſtice but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare M. <hi>Cawdreys</hi> work with it. Hereupon finding a great agreement between them, eſpecially in the latter and moſt plauſible part of M. <hi>Jeanes</hi> his rejoynder, he found it neceſſary for the Doctors fuller defence, as they ſay, to <hi>white</hi> and <hi>plaiſter</hi> two <hi>walls</hi> with the ſame <hi>morter</hi> and <hi>bruſh.</hi> And he was the more eaſily induced to this courſe for ſeverall Reaſons. Firſt becauſe M. <hi>Jeanes</hi> his <hi>uſe of confutation,</hi> and this <hi>reply</hi> were but <hi>Apologies</hi> of M. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> and deſigned for his defence in that part, on which the cauſe ſeemed moſt to lie. Secondly, becauſe at that time there was a confident report that M. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> was dead, which was the rather believed, becauſe he had ſo long been ſilent without any <hi>reply</hi> to the Doctor. And therefore M. <hi>Jeanes</hi> being thus by a kind ef <hi>jus leviratus</hi> next of <hi>kin</hi> to the <hi>dead,</hi> was now bound to <hi>marry</hi> the <hi>cauſe</hi> and <hi>raiſe up ſeed</hi> to his <hi>brother.</hi> And then thirdly, as many paſſages, for this end, were enlarged againſt M. <hi>Cawdrey,</hi> to give M. <hi>Jeanes</hi> occaſion to undertake the cauſe in groſs, ſo the Author conceived it very neceſſary for the Doctors vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, which in ſome places in the <hi>Account</hi> ſeemed (to him at leaſt) to need further <hi>proof</hi> or <hi>explication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how reaſonable ſoever this courſe did then ſeem to the Author, yet now he ſees it is likely to create him more trouble,
<pb facs="tcp:119243:10"/> then at firſt he expected. For he finds the report falſe, and that M. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> yet lives (and may he long live till he find either reaſon to <hi>recant,</hi> and own the Doctrines, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <hi>ſubſcribed to,</hi> but now decryes in D. <hi>Hammond,</hi> or elſe by better reaſons then yet he has urged, make the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor his <hi>Proſelyte)</hi> and that he has lately publiſhed an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi> ſhall I call it, or rather ſharp <hi>Invective?</hi> to the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors Account.</hi> A piece I may juſtly ſay as defective of <hi>true reaſon</hi> and <hi>argument</hi> as it is ſtuffed with <hi>calumny</hi> and <hi>reproach.</hi> And ſtrange it is that M. <hi>Cawdrey,</hi> who in his <hi>Triplex Diatribe</hi> was formerly ſo reſpectfull, ſhould now to the great <hi>diſparagement</hi> of his cauſe be as infamouſly <hi>virulent</hi> in oppoſing D. <hi>Hammonds</hi> Defence of the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> eſtabliſhed among us, which himſelf had <hi>ſubſcribed to,</hi> as <hi>S. W.</hi> or <hi>William Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant</hi> an eminent <hi>Proſelyte</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and a great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor for that perſwaſion in his ſeverall Treatiſes of <hi>Schiſm</hi> againſt the Doctors vindication of the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> it ſelf, and very <hi>being</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> But I have read of the <hi>Snake</hi> in the Fable, that when ſound in the Wood amidſt winter froſts and ſnow, was a very innocent thing, and might be handled without danger, was no ſooner warm in the Chimney corner, and refreſhed, and thawed by the fire, but it preſently began to hiſs, and ſhew that it had a ſting both in the head and the tail, and boldly and menacingly to ſtare in the face of its <hi>Patron.</hi> And I hope I may without offence make this impartiall obſervation from the ſtory of the Times; that it was juſt as low with <hi>Presbytery</hi> as now, when the <hi>Triplex Diatribe</hi> was writ, and we were then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame Maſters, as we are again at this day <hi>(—ſic me ſervavit Apollo)</hi> but it was afterwards ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken under the <hi>wings</hi> of a <hi>P.</hi> and it was no ſooner warm but it briſtled, and began to appear in its <hi>formidable</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:119243:10"/> likeneſs and durſt to <hi>look</hi> upon its <hi>maſter.</hi> But<hi>—Cynthius aurem vellit—</hi>I ſhall onely tell M. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> that though he ſtile his laſt work <hi>The Account Audited and Diſcounted,</hi> yet the way that he there takes, is a very ſtrange kind of <hi>Reckoning</hi> and <hi>Auditing</hi> of <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</hi> And mind him I muſt that it is the uſuall cuſtome of <hi>bad debtors,</hi> and <hi>ſtewards,</hi> where they cannot <hi>ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi> their Creditors, to <hi>rail</hi> at their demands, and when their <hi>purſes</hi> and <hi>bills</hi> are <hi>ſhort,</hi> to make <hi>payment</hi> and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> in <hi>bad</hi> language, that ſo at leaſt they may <hi>ſhame,</hi> where they find they cannot <hi>ſatisfie,</hi> and <hi>tire</hi> and <hi>weary</hi> where they cannot <hi>pay.</hi> Indeed for an Adverſary <hi>politick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to <hi>rail</hi> where he cannot <hi>conquer,</hi> and <hi>confidently</hi> to <hi>undervalue</hi> the force of that <hi>reaſon</hi> which he is unable to <hi>reſiſt</hi> or <hi>anſwer,</hi> is a very eaſie way of <hi>conſutation</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, but it is by <hi>libell,</hi> not by <hi>book.</hi> And ſuch pitifull <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates,</hi> that can onely <hi>calumniate</hi> and <hi>ſcold</hi> in behalf of a <hi>client</hi> without any <hi>ſolid plea,</hi> make a <hi>bad cauſe</hi> far <hi>worſe</hi> by ſuch manner of <hi>defence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as the Author does not envy this happineſs of M. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> in his <hi>auditing</hi> of <hi>accounts,</hi> ſo he is perſwaded that if this reply to M. <hi>Jeanes</hi> could have been publiſhed as ſoon as it was deſigned for the Preſs, he himſelf might alſo have received ſuch an anſwer as the Doctor has done, and been paid in the <hi>ſame coine,</hi> and ſo at leaſt had had a more <hi>ſpeciall call,</hi> then now he has, to take notice of M. <hi>Caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreys</hi> new manner of <hi>reckoning,</hi> and <hi>ſtating</hi> of <hi>accounts.</hi> But being not at all concerned in that Treatiſe, he was very willing, as yet, not to take any notice of it. And it was for theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt becauſe he ſaw, that what he had already written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt M. <hi>Cawd.</hi> needed not any further confirmation, there being nothing at all ſaid in this new <hi>Rejoynder</hi> to impair any thing here delivered. Secondly, becauſe if he ſhould have
<pb facs="tcp:119243:11"/> ſaid any thing more to this Reply of M. <hi>Cawdrey,</hi> the work already grown too unweildy, would have ſwelled to too large a bulk. And thirdly, becauſe it could not well be done without making too large <hi>digreſſions</hi> from M. <hi>Jeanes</hi> to follow a new adverſary, which would have made the diſcourſe too obſcure and intricate by ſuch unneceſſary diverſions. And fourthly, becauſe the Author was willing to try, how the Doctor, and the world would like his preſent undertakings, before he further intermedled with the Doctors buſineſs, who as he is moſt immediately concerned, ſo of all men he is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to undertake, and beſt able to perform it.</p>
            <p>Howſoever that our Author might not be wanting to the cauſe, he had thus already undertaken (though contrary to his firſt intention) during the time that this was under the Preſs, he caſt an eye upon M. <hi>Cawdreys Audit,</hi> and by way of <hi>Eſſay,</hi> to ſatisfie the Reader of the ſtrength of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, drew up an anſwer to one chapter that he conceived of moſt ſtrength in the whole book, and which had a great influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on all the reſt. But ſeeing that this work was big enough already, and could not with convenience admit of this <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix,</hi> he thought fit to ſuppreſs it, rather then at firſt be too troubleſome to the Reader, eſpecially becauſe he doubts not, but that the Doctor himſelf, if there ſhall be found cauſe, will not be wanting to gratifie the Reader far better, then himſelf could with this, which he had already provided.</p>
            <p>Howſoever if the Doctor ſhall think fit to <hi>decline</hi> this <hi>task,</hi> and the world ſhall judge M. <hi>Cawdreys Audit</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a <hi>review,</hi> this, which he intended to have added here by way of <hi>appendix,</hi> may in due time ſee light, with ſome <hi>additions</hi> and <hi>ſtrictures</hi> on the reſt, and M. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> may find a Perſon, far inferiour to the Doctor, that may call him to a <hi>new reckoning,</hi> before he receives his <hi>quietus eſt</hi> or Acquittance.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Alum omen in limine!</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> counted it <hi>Ominous,</hi> if they ſtumbled at the thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold, when they firſt ſet forth on any bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. Though I am far from approving any ſuch ridiculous ſuperſtitions, and fond idle conceipts, yet I cannot behold it as any proſperous Symptome of this <hi>Refuter's</hi> fair carriage in the Managing this controverſie, that he ſhould thus palpably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicate in the very Frontiſpiece of his Pamphlet.</p>
               <p>§. 2. For whereas Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> had thus ſtiled his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

               <p>§. 3. For how many be there in the world, whoſe buſineſs will not ſuffer them, or whoſe curioſity will not carry them on, to read further than the very Titles of Books? And yet theſe from this <hi>Lantſchap-Diſcovery</hi> can talk as confidently, and cenſure as ſeverely, as if they had throughly read and weighed every line and Period in the whole Diſcourſe. How many are there that read Books out of Intereſt and faction, that are paſſionately deſirous that every one ſhould be in the wrong, &amp; confuted, that is not of their party? Theſe weigh not reaſons but names, and put not judgement into the ballance, but preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and advantage. They had rather truth ſhould ſuffer, than the cauſe they are engaged in, and are abundantly ſatisfied to ſee an Adverſary anſwered, whatſoever Arts or Means are made uſe of to blow up a Refutation. How many alſo are there in the world, that are not able to diſtinguiſh truth from Pretences, and ſhapes and Pictures from ſolid bodies? that think all is right that is vehemently pretended, and every Apparition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that preſents it ſelf to their deluded ſenſe and Imagination? Nay how few are there even of thoſe who have the skill and abilities to judge, that either have the patience, or the leaſure, in controverſies of this nature, to compare Author with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and Reply and Rejoynder together?</p>
               <p>§. 4. And yet who ſeeth not, but every one of thoſe (which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether make up the only conſiderable number of Readers) are likely to be impoſed on by this Change, and Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> be concluded guilty in their Judgements of a groſs and palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miſtake?</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:119243:18"/>
               <p> §. 5. For who is there almoſt ſo green a <hi>Catechumen</hi> and <hi>Neophyte</hi> in the Chriſtian faith, that knows God to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, and the laſt end of Man, but will be ready to reply againſt the Doctor, that we cannot love God ſufficiently, and that we muſt therefore love him to the utmoſt height we can; that he who <hi>loves not God with all his heart, with all his ſoul, and with all his might,</hi> doth not love him as much as God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, or as much as man ought; and therefore to maintain a greater Ardency in Chriſt's love of God at one time than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, muſt be a dangerous Error, &amp; bordering on that <hi>Hereſie</hi> that denyes the God-head of our Saviour; an Error that pulls the Crown of innocence and happineſs and perfection from his head? Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> right or wrong, is now abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confuted in the Judgement of the <hi>Many,</hi> and it will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt an impoſſible Task, and an unpardonable crime to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take his defence. So great <hi>a School-man</hi> as Mr. <hi>Henry Jeanes</hi> of <hi>Chedzey</hi> has loſt his labour in this rejoynder, and has been only too curteous in honouring Doctor <hi>Hammonds</hi> groſs Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, with a Scholaſtical Refutation. His Arguments and Pains might have been ſpared in oppoſing that ſo palpable miſtake, which at firſt-ſight diſcovers it ſelf in the naked propoſal of it.</p>
               <p>§. 6. Indeed this Phraſe, <hi>The love of God,</hi> to Engliſh eares carries with it nothing leſs than that high and tranſcendent Act of the Soul, that immediately fixes on God as it's proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. And therefore if the Doctor had undertaken to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that this Act of <hi>Divine Love</hi> had not alwayes been at the ful height in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who by virtue of the <hi>Hypoſtatical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> ſo cleerly alwayes knew God, and ſo perfectly enjoyed him, his learning and parts would in the Judgement of moſt, have only ſerved him to parget o're an Error, too groſs and palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be defended by any man that owns and glories in the name of a Chriſtian, and a Preacher of the Goſpel, and his work would be juſtly accounted fit to be joyned to the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Paradoxes of the age; and the <hi>Panegyricks</hi> of <hi>Nero</hi> and the <hi>Altar</hi> of <hi>Buſiris</hi> would have been reputed as true, though to carry infinite leſs danger in them, than this Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So ſucceſsful has this alteration been to our <hi>Refuters</hi> Advantage!</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:119243:19"/>
               <p> §. 7. But then if the Doctors Poſition had been faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, and the Queſtion laid down in theſe preciſe Terms, wherein he had ſo warily ſtated it, not one of a thouſand Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders could have found any fault with it. And if ſo great a <hi>School-man</hi> as Mr. <hi>Henry Jeanes</hi> of <hi>Chedzey</hi> pretends himſelf to be, could, with all his skill and advantage in that curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſubtile learning, have diſcovered in it a miſtake, the Error would in the Judgement of the moſt have been accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>venial,</hi> and ſuch, which the moſt profound and knowing might be ſubject to. For even Saint <note n="*" place="margin">Luke 22. 44.</note> 
                  <hi>Luke</hi> himſelf does po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively declare, that our Saviour <hi>being in an Agony,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>prayed more earneſtly;</hi> which is the very thing that the Doctor aſſerts in his Title Page: and all the buſineſs of his reply is to prove, how this plain Aſſertion of the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> may be reconciled with his fulneſs of habitual grace. And therefore when our great <hi>Schoolman</hi> had done the utmoſt here he could, the ſum totall of his performance would, in moſt mens opinion, have been only this, That he had ſhewed a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way of reconciling this Text of Saint <hi>Luke</hi> with the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Habitual Grace in Chriſt, than Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> had yet met with.</p>
               <p>§. 8. If now our Refuter ſhall here return, that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took not to oppoſe Doctor <hi>Hammonds</hi> Title, but his Book, and that in divers places of his Reply he poſitively maintains, that the Acts of Chriſts love of God were capable of degrees, more Ardent at ſome time than others, which was the dangerous Error he was willing to Reprieve and ſecure the Reader from, and therefore he hath done the Doctor no wrong, if in thoſe terms he propoſed to Refute it in the <hi>Frontiſpiece</hi> of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder, which being his own Child, he might name as he pleaſed, without any mans juſt offence;</p>
               <p>§. 9. <hi>To this I Anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That true it is that this Phraſe, <hi>The Love of God,</hi> is variouſly taken in Scripture, as ſhall in due place be largely demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</p>
               <p>Firſt generally for the habit, or any Act or Acts of holy
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119243:19"/> Charity, as it conteins the whole duty of man towards God and our Neighbours.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in a more reſtrained ſenſe, for the Habit, or any Acts of Piety, or Holineſs, or devotion towards God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, moſt ſtrictly and properly, for that high and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Act of divine love, whereby the ſoul is immediately fixed and knit to God as the only Good.</p>
               <p>In the two firſt acceptations the <hi>Denomination</hi> is only <hi>Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative</hi> and <hi>Cauſal,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Acts,</hi> ſo called, are the <hi>Effects</hi> and <hi>iſſues</hi> of the love of God. In the third and laſt, the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination</hi> is <hi>Formal</hi> and <hi>Proper,</hi> and ſignifies nothing elſe but that <hi>Love</hi> from whence thoſe other <hi>Acts</hi> do flow.</p>
               <p>§. 10. If therefore Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> ſpeaking of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Ardency in Chriſt's Prayer, and the gradual height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of other Acts of like nature in him, according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of times and occaſions, doe's ſometimes by a <hi>Metonymy</hi> of the effect, or <hi>Synecdoche generis,</hi> ſay, that theſe Acts of Chriſts love of God, or holy Charity, are capable of degrees, and ſometimes more heightned, more ardent and intenſe than at other times, or in other Acts, this will therefore be no excuſe to our <hi>Refuter</hi> for charging Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> in his <hi>Frontiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece,</hi> for aſſerting a greater Ardency in Chriſts Love of God (properly and formally taken) at one time than another, and notwithſtanding any ſuch plea or defence he muſt, <note n="*" place="margin">

                           <p>§. 1. I Was very willing to hearken to the ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble adviſe of many, and wholly to withdraw my ſelf <hi>à foro contentioſo,</hi> to ſome more pleaſing and profitable imployment, but diſcerning it to be the deſire of the Author of the Book intituled, <hi>A Mixture of Scholaſtical &amp; Practical Divinity,</hi> that I ſhould reply to his examination of one paſſage of mine againſt Mr. <hi>Cawdrey,</hi> I ſhall make no ſcruple immediately to obey him, not only becauſe it may be done in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few words, but eſpecially becauſe the Doctrine which he affixeth to me, ſeems (and not without ſome reaſon) to be contrary to the truth of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which I am to look on with all reverent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and acquieſce in with captivation of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and ſo not aſſert any thing from mine own conceptions, which is but ſeemingly contrary to it.</p>

                           <p> §. 2. The Propoſition which he affixes to me is this, That <hi>Chriſts Love of God was capable of further degrees:</hi> and that he refutes as a thing contrary to that point (a truth of Scripture) which he had in hand, viz. <hi>The dwelling of all fulneſs of habitual Grace in Chriſt.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. By this I ſuppoſe I may conclude his meaning to be, that I have affirmed <hi>Chriſts Love of God</hi> (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereby the habitual Grace of divine Charity) to have been capable of further degrees, ſo as that Capacity of further degrees is the denyal of all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that habitual Grace already in him.</p>
                           <p n="4">4.

                           <p n="5">5. This I could eaſily ſhew, and withall how cautiouſly and expreſly it was foreſtalled by me. But to the matter in hand, it is ſufficient that I profeſs I never thought it, but deemed it a contrariety to expreſs words of Scripture in any man who ſhall think it, and in ſhort, that I never gave occaſion to any man to believe it my opinion, having never ſaid it in thoſe words which he ſets up to refute in me, never in any other that may be reaſonably interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to this ſenſe.</p>

               <p>§. 1. TO this ſo ingenuous and civil addreſs, and clear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the danger of that Error which the <hi>Author of the Mixture</hi> undertook to refute, though cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, in Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> this <hi>Refuter</hi> in very much anger re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, and with pride and ſcorn ſufficient to oppoſe a thouſand Hereticks.

Becauſe he hath once unhappily accuſed the Doctor of an Error which he is no way guilty of, <hi>which he never gave occaſion to any man to believe his opinion, having never ſaid it in thoſe words which he ſets up to refute in him,</hi> and <hi>never in any other that may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be interpreted to that dangerous ſenſe,</hi> he will ſtill perverſly continue to affix it on him.</p>
               <p>§. 2. And this is all the thanks that the Doctor hath gained by this his fair condeſcenſion, and labouring to undeceive this miſtaken Author, and thoſe that poſſibly might be deceived by him. His recompence is only the diſturbing of his peace, the blaſting of his name, and a provocation to a very impertinent and unneceſſary debate in any times, but now highly diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the Glory of God, and the Proteſtant Religion, which is ſo every where aſſaulted, both by enemies from without, and unruly Profeſſors and Pretenders to it within.</p>
               <p>§. 3. And though as the caſe now ſtands with our ſad and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much afflicted Mother the Church, this contention might have been pardonable, if it had been carryed with that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and candor as becomes Profeſſors of Goſpel-Truths, though differing in Judgement in ſome petite and inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble debates; yet to the great contentment of the <hi>Jeſuite</hi> abroad,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119243:22"/> and the <hi>Quaker</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> at home, it is managed with ſuch vehemence, and ſcorn, and Paſſion, as if the whole Honour and ſafety of Chriſtian Religion did depend upon it.</p>
               <p>§ 4. And now, though his Opinion and Judgement is Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, and altogether the ſame with that which <hi>the Author of the Mixture of Scholaſtical Divinity with practical</hi> undertook to maintain; yet his innocent language ſhall be arraigned of <hi>Ironies</hi> and ſcorn, and hypocritical <hi>high complements,</hi> and his Tongue and Pen ſhall be concluded guilty, where his Heart and Tenents cannot. For thus he beſpeaks the Doctor;</p>

               <p> §. 7.

I ſee you arrogate to your ſelf the glorious Attribute of a <hi>School-man,</hi> and every where pride your ſelf in your <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtical</hi> diſcourſe. The <hi>Logician</hi> ſtill diſputes or fights (as they ſpeak) <hi>pugno contracto.</hi> His fiſt is always clutched, to ſhew the power and the ſtrength of his diſcourſe.

I confeſs, I have no regret at all to your Perſon, nor do I envy you the Acqueſts you have gotten in School-Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, too much a ſtranger now-a-dayes. No ſuch unchriſtian Temptation has drawn me from my obſcure private ſhade into the Sunſhine. It is only love of truth, and the vindicating a Learned Man's name, who was reſolved to confute you by his neglect, and purſue nobler thoughts than ſuch poor and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial controverſies, has brought me into the Theater.</p>
               <p>§. 13. And now, if I prove you not extremely ignorant of the firſt Principles, and very <hi>Elements</hi> of Logick and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; if I do not demonſtrate that you quote School-Authors at random, which you never read; if I make it not evident, that you have either ignorantly, or, which is worſe, moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully miſtook the Doctors meaning, and impoſed an Aſſertion on him which he never meant, and will as readily diſ-own as you your ſelf (which yet, for all that, you have no where confuted, at leaſt to any purpoſe;) if I make it not clear as the Sun at Noon, that you have not urged one Author to purpoſe; nay, that all the Authors almoſt you have cited, do directly make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you; let me then be decryed for the moſt monſtrous Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and Sycophant, or any worſe thing, that Chriſtianity abominates.</p>
               <p n="14">14. This courſe I confeſs is no wayes pleaſing to me, and I had rather uſe (as he counſelled) <hi>ſoft words</hi> and <hi>hard Arguments,</hi> becauſe I find by experience that Truth is never at a greater loſs, than in a Perſonal Diſpute, and the diſcovery of the Error and miſtakes of an Adverſary that are nothing to the Cauſe.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:119243:23"/>
               <p> §. 15. But let the world be Judge, what other courſe ſhould be taken with ſuch a touchy Oppoſite, that is offended with the Doctor for ſaying, <hi>He ſhould make no ſcruple to obey his deſires,</hi> and has vouchſafed him that Reply, which he confeſſes he is <hi>unworthy of.</hi> I have found by experience, that if you ſoftly han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the Nettle, it will ſting you for your Courteſie: but if you roughly cruſh it, you ſhall find it a very innocent Plant, and not able to offend you. Since therefore I perceive this Refuter has ſomewhat of this angry Herb in him, it will be neceſſary for my own defence that I handle him accordingly.</p>
               <p>§. 16. But let me tell you, Sir, the Doctor is too much a Chriſtian to be guilty of <hi>high Complements</hi> in Theological diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes; and he is too Charitable and humble to <hi>ſcoff</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride</hi> an Adverſary, though never ſo weak and unworthy. All the world ſees, that though his Inke be black and laſting, yet he has no Copperas and Gall in it; nor could the intemperate Language of any Scurrilous Oppoſite yet tempt him to forgo his ſettled Meekneſs and Patience. Your <hi>Friends</hi> then that <hi>repreſented</hi> to you that fair and civil expreſſion of the Doctors under the <hi>notion</hi> of a <hi>Scoff,</hi> were the only Authors of it, and you muſt accuſe them of the <hi>Deriſion</hi> that feigned it, where it was not at all intended.</p>
               <p>§. 17. And now if what you adde in this Paragraph, has in ſincerity fallen from your Pen; and if alſo, though it had been intended by the Doctor not only as an <hi>high complement,</hi> but a <hi>ſcoff</hi> (as <hi>you</hi> and your <hi>Friends</hi> do vainly phanſie) yet it <hi>ſhall abate nothing of your gratitude</hi> to him for his <hi>Reply (which is a favour and honour</hi> you juſtly <hi>confeſs your ſelf unworthy of,</hi> unleſs you had made better uſe of it;) I ſhall not deſpair, but that my plain and down-right managing this Controverſie againſt you may be acceptable, and that you will yet thank me for my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt reproofs, which, if I be not very much miſtaken, will ſhew you more ignorant than either your ſelf or Admirers imagine. And I have good hopes yet, that you may prove <hi>Senex bonae indolis,</hi> and acknowledge your miſtakes in a publick
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119243:24"/> Recantation: which will be as great an Honour to your ſelf, as a Repairing the Doctors Credit, which you have to the great diſſervice of the Church ſo unworthily blaſted, whoſe Labours in Gods Vineyard are made by it unfruitful to many that might otherwiſe have profited by them.

               <p>§. 4.

               <p>§. 5. Howſoever, Sir, if you ſhould not be ſo honeſt as to make good your publick <hi>Promiſe,</hi> ſo ingenuous as to retract a cauſeleſs injury, done to an innocent, learned, highly-deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Perſon (as indeed I look for little from you) yet I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Reader to take notice that the <hi>Terms of the Queſtion</hi> are much altered now, in this Rejoynder, from what they were at firſt. At firſt this Refuter charged the Doctor with a <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>flat denyal</hi> of the <hi>All-fulneſs of Habitual Grace in Chriſt,</hi> and for proof of this his Accuſation, he quoted a Paſſage taken from the two hundredth twenty ſecond Page of his <hi>Account of Mr. Cawdrey's triplex Diatribe,</hi> where, in the fourth and fifth <hi>Paragraphs</hi> of that Page, the words are truly found.</p>

                  </gap> has ſo fully clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf from that Crimination, ſince there he has ſo publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared his Opinion of the All-fulneſs of Habitual Grace in Chriſt, and there profeſſed (who beſt of all men knew his own opinions) <hi>that he never did think otherwiſe, but deemed it a contrariety to expreſs words of Scripture in any man who ſhould be of that Judgement, and,</hi> in ſhort, <hi>having declared that he never gave occaſion to any man to believe it his opinion, having never ſaid it in thoſe words which this Author ſets up to refute in him, nor ever in any other that may be reaſonably interpretable to that ſenſe;</hi> Now this <hi>Refuter,</hi> in his Rejoynder to the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>§. 2. But this is one of the ſmalleſt miſadventures our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer</hi> will appear guilty of: and therefore I ſhall not fix upon it, eſpecially ſince it matters not much, if the Doctor be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved obnoxious to the Error charged upon him, what the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was that firſt did move him to confute it.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Yet for his comfort I muſt tell him, that as his firſt undertaking was altogether groundleſs, ſo this whole Proceſs is ridiculous, and only a great heap of Errors and miſtakes.</p>
               <p>§. 4. For firſt, he very ignorantly or wilfully confounds the <hi>Immanent Acts of Love</hi> with the <hi>Action of Loving,</hi> things that are <hi>toto genere</hi> different. For this is a <hi>Praedicamental Action,</hi> and the other are <hi>Qualities</hi> ſpecifically diſtinct from the <hi>habit</hi> of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119243:28"/> Love, as ſhall in due place be demonſtrated. And he could not but know that the Doctor poſitively does maintain it in the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and therefore muſt not by the Rules of Art be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be otherwiſe, without a Pittiful <hi>begging of the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> till the contrary has been proved againſt him. This Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument then of which he is ſo confident, that <hi>he ſhall ſubmit it to the Doctors moſt ſevere examination,</hi> at the very firſt glance appears an empty <hi>Paralogiſm,</hi> that cannot conclude any thing againſt the Doctor. For the Syllogiſm, let it be put into what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <hi>form</hi> this <hi>Refuter</hi> can deviſe, will conſiſt of four <hi>terms</hi> (the Doctor by the <hi>Acts of Love,</hi> in the <hi>Concluſion,</hi> to be brought againſt him, meaning the <hi>Quality</hi> of <hi>Actual Love,</hi> and the <hi>Refuter</hi> in one of the Premiſſes by the <hi>Acts of Love</hi> underſtanding the <hi>Predicamental Action of Loving)</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently there can be no oppoſition, becauſe it cannot be <hi>ad idem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 5. But then ſecondly, ſuppoſe we his Diſcourſe were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial, yet it will not at all concern the Aſſertion of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor. For Intenſion and Remiſſion is properly a gradual height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or abatement of the ſame <hi>Numerical</hi> Form, as we ſhall hereafter prove. But the Doctor never affirms, as I can find, that the ſelf-ſame <hi>Numerical</hi> Act of Holy Love in Chriſt was more intenſe at one time than at another, which this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuppoſes. He only affirms that Chriſt in one Act of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love, or <hi>holy Charity,</hi> (for this alone the Doctor means, as ſhall in due place be evidenced, though this <hi>Refuter</hi> either ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly or wilfully miſtakes it, for that high and moſt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Act of Love that was immediately fixed on God as its proper Object) was more ardent than in another, as, in his dying for us, than in his ſuffering Hunger, Poverty, Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for our ſakes: or that this inward Act of divine Charity in Chriſt was more ardent and intenſe than thoſe other were.</p>
               <p>Now this Aſſertion, as it is a Truth clearly demonſtrable (and ſhall in due place be made good) ſo it is not any wayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this Argument of the <hi>Refuter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 6. For though true it is, that <hi>Actions are not intended, but</hi>

                  <hi>by reaſon of Qualities;</hi> yet this nothing hinders, but that one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Action may Comparatively and Reſpectively be more intenſe than another, even where the gradual height of both is ſuppoſed to be ſtill Simply and Abſolutely invariable, ſtill the ſame. For inſtance; Illumination is a proper Praedicamental Action; and yet Senſe and experience tells us, that the illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Sun, and the illumination of any one of the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Stars, are gradually different, and yet the illumination of both is ſtill the ſame in it ſelf, and never varies, but by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, in reſpect of the variety of the <hi>Medium,</hi> or diſtance: becauſe the Original light of the Sun and Stars is ſtill invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <note n="*" place="margin">Ariſtot. li. 2. <hi>de Generat. &amp; corrupt.</hi> c. 10. text. 56.</note>

And therefore notwithſtanding this <hi>Refuters</hi> Argument, I ſee no reaſon why alſo it may not be ſo in reſpect of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral individual Acts of Chriſt's Love, and that, though they in themſelves be ſuppoſed to continue ſtill invariable, of one equal intenſion in themſelves, they may not yet, in compariſon and reſpect of one another, be ſaid to be more or leſs ardent and intenſe.</p>
               <p>§. 8. For thirdly (to ſhew this <hi>Refuters</hi> Diſcourſe yet more impertinent) though moſt certain it is (as the Doctor clearly grants and maintains) that the Habit of Divine Charity in Chriſt was <hi>de facto</hi> alwayes at the height, and in its utmoſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that a finite Nature was capable of; yet it is not therefore neceſſary that every Act of holy Charity ſhould be alwayes in its <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> and full height: nor will it thence follow, that every Act of this Habit ſhould be equally intenſe with the Cauſe from whence it flowes; but may differ in degrees not only from the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119243:29"/> Habit, but alſo from all other Acts ſpringing from it; unleſs this <hi>Refuter</hi> can by other Arguments than this prove a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the gradual determination and equality of intenſneſs of the ſeveral Acts with the Habit.</p>
               <p>§. 9. Now all things that are any wayes determined, muſt of neceſſity be determined either <hi>ab intrinſeco,</hi> or <hi>ab extrinſeco;</hi> from ſome internal cauſe, and neceſſity of nature, or from ſome outward bounds and limitations.</p>
               <p>§. 10. <hi>Ab intra</hi> there can be imagined no determination poſſible, as his Maſter <hi>Scheibler</hi> may teach him.

               <p>What then ſayes <hi>Scheibler</hi> to this purpoſe in the place quoted by our <hi>Refuter?</hi> and let us duly conſider it.</p>
               <p>The queſtion indeed is, <hi>An omnis Actio habeat Terminum?</hi> Concerning which he reckons up firſt three Opinions, and then he addes his own, <hi>Ego quod mihi videatur hâc in re per diſtinct as propoſitiones propono.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the firſt is, 1. <hi>Dico, Actiones immanentes revera ſum Actiones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be it granted; for I know no able Philoſopher, eſpecially of late, that denies it, and the contrary Arguments have ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been anſwered by <hi>Suarez</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, 2. <hi>Dico, Actiones immanentes aliquae non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent terminum, aliquae eoſdem habent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third, which follows by way of <hi>Corollary</hi> from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, 3. <hi>Dico, Actio ut ſic non dicit reſpectum ad terminum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is all that <hi>Scheibler</hi> undertakes to maintain in the place quoted by the <hi>Refuter.</hi> Vide <hi>Scheib. Metaphyſ.</hi> l. 2. c. 10. tit. 3. art. 3. punct. 1. n. 26. ad 36.</p>

               <p>§. 18. Now to prove that <hi>nulla Actio immanens habet termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> (which muſt be the Refuters Propoſition, if he ſpeak any thing to the purpoſe; for how elſe will he prove that the immanent Acts of Love have no Termes by this <hi>Medium?)</hi> by this aſſertion of <hi>Scheibler,</hi> that ſpeaks only of ſome ſuch, and proves the contrary of others, will be impoſſible, till he can ſhew us a new <hi>Mood</hi> and <hi>Figure</hi> to prove an <hi>

               </p>
               <p>§. 19. Indeed it might have been ſomewhat to the purpoſe, if that Author had undertaken to prove that either the <hi>Operations</hi> of <hi>Infuſed Habits,</hi> or particularly the <hi>Operations</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Habit</hi> of <hi>Charitie,</hi> had no <hi>Terminus.</hi> But this as it is moſt falſe in it ſelf (as ſhall in due place be evinced) ſo that Author undertakes not to maintain.</p>
               <p>§. 20. All that ſeems to look that way is this, §. 29, 30. in the proof of the ſecond Propoſition. <hi>Patet autem utrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que. Nam inprimis datur aliquis Actus immanens</hi>

And therefore it follows not, that if <hi>Actions immanent</hi> be <hi>Praedicamental Actions,</hi> and have their <hi>Terminos,</hi> that therefore their terms muſt <hi>remain,</hi> as in <hi>Artificial</hi> productions and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions moſt commonly they do. For though it be affirmed to be

His words moſt pertinent to this purpoſe are theſe;<hi>—Cum omnis motus vel actio ſit via in terminum per ipſum productum, quaelibet harum actionum (ſc. appetitus ſenſitivi) proprium habet terminum, &amp; quidem terminus tranſmutationis corporalis ſenſu percipitur—Terminus vero actionis appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titus non percipitur ſenſu, quemadmodum neque actio ipſa: Iram enim, niſi aliqua alteratione Corporis oſtendatur, vel certe verbis aut ſignis, non agnoſcimus; ſed cum ſit Actio cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porea, abſque dubio habet proprium terminum, nomine ejuſdem actionis ſignificatum, ut oſtendunt Operationes Voluntatis &amp; ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miles.

But let the bold <hi>Jeſuite</hi> think what he pleaſe, yet our modeſt, humble <hi>Refuter dares not think ſo diſhonourably of our Bleſſed Saviour, as to attribute ſuch imperfect inchoate things as Diſpoſitions unto him:</hi> and the Doctor cannot ſay they are <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, without contradicting himſelf,</hi> and embracing the <hi>Error</hi> he would ſeem to renounce.</p>
               <p>§. 36. But here our <hi>Refuter,</hi> though he pretend to be a <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> betrayes his groſs Ignorance, and is abundantly miſtaken. For though <hi>Diſpoſitions,</hi> which are in order to <hi>Acquiſite</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, are <hi>inchoate and imperfect things,</hi> and to attribute <hi>ſuch</hi> to our Bleſſed Saviour might be juſtly deemed to derogate from the fulneſs of his ſupernaturally infuſed <hi>habit</hi> of Divine Grace; yet the Qualities that terminate Immanent Acts iſſuing from that Divine Habit, are not in themſelves inchoate and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and ordained to <hi>further Habits,</hi> but are all perfect in their kinds, or may be even as intenſively perfect as the Habit from whence they proceed.

               <p>§. 46.

Let him tell me, how it is poſſible the firſt horn of his <hi>Dilemma</hi> or Captious Argument (wherein all the ſtrength and terror lay) being broken and deſtroyed, that the Doctor ſhould be in any the leaſt danger of the other. What neceſſity now is there, and let our <hi>Refuter</hi> himſelf judge, that the Doctor muſt be forced to ſay that this <hi>Quality</hi> is a <hi>Habit?</hi> and conſequently what will become of his Inference, That the Doctor muſt by <hi>conſequence affirm</hi> what he <hi>ſeems</hi> to <hi>deny?</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if the Doctor had aſſerted that the <hi>Habit,</hi> the Principle of theſe Acts, had been intended, he had <hi>formally</hi> contradicted himſelf; or if he had ſaid that ſome <hi>Habit,</hi> the <hi>terminus</hi> of thoſe Acts, and produced and acquired by them, had been inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he had ſpoken and affirmed a kind of contradiction <hi>in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecto:</hi> for then he had affirmed that a pure ſupernatural Grace, that ſolely depends upon the gift and infuſion of God, had been acquired by humane Acts and endeavors. But then if he had ſo ſaid, this had not been to have <hi>contradicted</hi> himſelf.

And therefore our <hi>Refuter</hi> was as much miſtaken in this attempt as in any of the reſt.</p>
               <p>§. 47. But let me tell him, that as the Doctor had no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to lay down ſuch an Aſſertion, ſo he was too ſound and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> to do it; though yet this <hi>Refuter</hi> does every where decry him for a <hi>Dunce,</hi> and <hi>bragge he has ſo made him.</hi> And therefore I ſhall only ſay, that ſince the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor had ſo often and ſo early, and withall ſo clearly, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed this Opinion, in regard of the intenſive growth of our Bleſſed Saviours <hi>Habitual Grace</hi> of <hi>Divine Love,</hi> the <hi>Refuter</hi> in my Judgement could have no other aim in the re-doubling this charge in the cloſe of his Argument, but only to fill up his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and ſwell it into a volume.

                           <p>In the next place he paſſeth to the inforcement of my Argument from what we read concerning Chriſt himſelf, that he was more intenſe in Prayer at one time than at another, when yet the lower degree was ſure no ſin, and prepares to anſwer it, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt was above the Law, and did more than the Law required, but men fall ſhort by many degrees of what is required. But ſure this anſwer is nothing to the matter in hand, for the evidencing of which that example was brought by me, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſincere Love is capable of Degrees. This was firſt ſhewed in ſeveral men, and in the ſame man at ſeveral times, in the ſeveral ranks of Angels, and at laſt in Chriſt himſelf, more ardent in one act of Prayer than in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
                           <p n="8">8. Here the Reader finds not the words <hi>(Chriſts Love of God is capable of further Degrees,)</hi> and when by deduction he endeavours to conclude them from theſe words, his concluſion falls ſhort in one word, viz. <hi>(further)</hi> and 'tis but this,</p>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119243:39"/> muſt oblige himſelf to an exact recital of it to a word and ſyllable, otherwiſe he may himſelf become the only Author of the Propoſition which he refutes.</p>

                           <p n="11">11. For this Propoſition <hi>(Chriſts Love of God was capable of further Degrees)</hi> is readily interpretable to this dangerous ſenſe, that Chriſts Love of God was not full, but ſo far imperfect, as to be capable of ſome further Degrees than yet it had. And thus ſure the Author I have now before me acknowledges to have underſtood the words, and accordingly profeſſeth to refute them from the conſideration of the All-fulneſs of habitual Grace in Chriſt, which he could not do, unleſs he deemed them a prejudice to it.</p>
                           <p n="12">12. But theſe other words, which though he finds not in my Papers, he yet not illogically inferrs from them (that Chriſts Love of God was capable of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, more intenſe at one time than at another) are not ſo liable to be thus interpreted, but only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that Chriſt's Love of God had in its latitude or amplitude ſeveral Degrees, one differing from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>ſecundum magis &amp; minus,</hi> all of them compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in that All-full perfect Love of God, which was alwayes in Chriſt ſo full and ſo perfect, as not to want, and ſo not to be capable of further Degrees.</p>
                           <p n="13">13. The matter is clear: The Degrees of which Chriſts Love of God is capable, are by me thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, that his Love was more intenſe at one time than at another; but ſtill the higher of thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of intenſeneſs was as truly acknowledged to

               <p>§. 10. To begin with the <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> where the ſtrength of the <hi>Inference</hi> ſeems moſt to be lodged. I deny it, Sir, I deny it. For where I pray does the Doctor affirm this? Is it in theſe words §. 11. where he ſaies expreſly, <hi>That this propoſition, Chriſts Love of God was capable of further Degrees, is readily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretable to this dangerous ſenſe,</hi> (I pray mark it) <hi>that Chriſts Love of God was not full, but ſo far imperfect, as to be capable of ſome further Degrees then yet it had?</hi> Or is it in thoſe other §. 12. <hi>That Chriſts Love of God was capable of Degrees, more intenſe at one time then at another, that is, Chriſts Love of God had in its latitude or amplitude ſeveral Degrees, one differing from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> ſecundum magis &amp; minus, <hi>all of them comprehended in that all-full perfect Love of God</hi> (I pray mark it) <hi>which was alwayes in Chriſt ſo full and ſo perfect</hi> (good Sir, I pray mark,) <hi>as not to want, ſo not to be capable of further Degrees?</hi> If in theſe two Aſſertions the direct contrary to what you conclude from the Doctors words be laid down, as his proper meaning, what a ſtrange unhappy man is this Doctor in his expreſſion, (that yet was once thought ſo eminent for his Language and <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> as to be choſen in <hi>publique Convocation</hi> for the <hi>

               <p> §. 11. But perhaps he will collect it from the following words in the next <hi>Paragraph,</hi> §. 13. <hi>The Degrees of which Chriſts Love of God is capable are by me thus expreſſed: That his Love was more intenſe at one time then at another, but ſtill the higher of theſe Degrees of intenſeneſs was as truly acknowledged to be in Chriſts Love at ſome time, viz. in his Agony, as the lower was at another; and ſo all the Degrees which are ſuppoſed to be mentioned of his Love, are alſo ſuppoſed and expreſly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to have been in him at ſome time or other: whereas a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed capacity of farther Degrees ſeems at leaſt (&amp; is ſo reſolved by that Author) to infer that theſe Degrees were not in Chriſt (the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect contradictory to the former Propoſition,) and ſo that they were wanting in him; and the but-ſeeming aſſerting of that want is juſtly cenſured as prejudicial to that fulneſs.</hi>

The <note place="margin">3. <hi>Ibid.</hi> leg. 114.</note> third is, <hi>In obſcuris inſpici ſolet quod veriſimilius eſt, aut quod plerumque fieri ſolet,</hi> That in things that are dark and obſcure, we muſt uſe to regard that which is the moſt probable and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be true, or that which moſt commonly is wont to be done. The reaſon and equity of them is ſo great, that they are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally approved of. For what writing or ſpeech is there in the world, wherein the obſcure and doubtful expreſſions are not, and in Juſtice ought not to be, expounded by the plain? Is not this the courſe in all Courts of Judicature in the world? Is it not uſual in all Contracts, and familiar in all Diſcourſes and Diſputes? And is it not a ruled caſe, both in the Pulpit and the Schooles, to unriddle the dark and doubtful intricate places of Scripture by the more clear and manifeſt?

               </p>
               <p>§. 14. And ſhall not the Doctor have ſo much favour allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him as to obtain common Juſtice? Or ſhall that be a fault in him which is not ſo in all other Writers? It is not only the Fate of <hi>Riddles</hi> and <hi>Oracles</hi> to be obſcure. <note n="*" place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 16.</note> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles</hi> has <hi>many things hard to be underſtood,</hi> as well as <hi>Ezechiel</hi> and the <hi>Revelation.</hi> Words and Language, Sir, are too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to expreſs the notions of the Mind; nor are they alwayes faithful interpreters to others of thoſe Thoughts they were deſigned to repreſent.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:119243:43"/>
               <p> §. 15. And therefore, Sir, I beſeech you to allow this Plea at leaſt for the Doctor, and if there be in this <hi>Paragraph</hi> any ſeeming contradiction to his own true and proper meaning, and former plain expreſſions, let the one reconcile the other; and though you and the Doctor differ in judgement, yet be not ſo uncharitable as to make him at variance with himſelf.</p>

               <p>§. 17. But the truth is, the Doctor needs no ſuch defence. The matter is clear to any man that will not wilfully miſtake. And thus the Caſe ſtands. The Doctor in the former <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph</hi> had declared his Opinion of <hi>Chriſts all-full perfect ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Divine Love,</hi> which he acknowledges was alwayes in him, ſo full and ſo perfect, as not to <hi>want,</hi> and <hi>ſo not to be capable of further Degrees.</hi> And this he is not only willing to <hi>aſſert,</hi> but alſo to <hi>demonſtrate.</hi> And an Argument he borrowes from that very Sentence that the <hi>Refuter</hi> firſt cavilled at; and it proceeds <hi>à Poſteriori,</hi> from the Effect to the Cauſe, thus: If Chriſts Love of God (in the Act and exerciſe) was capable of Degrees, more intenſe at one time then another, and had in its latitude or amplitude ſeveral Degrees, one different from another <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum magis &amp; minus,</hi> all of them comprehended in (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe iſſuing from) the Habit of Divine Love, then this habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Love of God muſt be acknowledged all-full and perfect, alwaies in him ſo full and ſo perfect as not to want, and ſo not to be capable of <hi>further Degrees.</hi> But the Antecedent is true, and therefore alſo the Conſequent. The evidence of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele is ſuppoſed &amp; grounded upon two very known Maximes; <hi>Nihil eſt in Effectu quod non prius erat in Cauſa,</hi> and, <hi>Nihil dat quod non habet.</hi> And therefore if the Acts be the Effect, and the Habit the Cauſe (<note n="*" place="margin">De Habiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus infuſis longe diverſa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ratio eſt; nam ſine illis non habet potentia ullum principium intrinſecum, proportionatum propriis actibus talium habituum <hi>Suarez.</hi> Metaph. diſp. 44. ſect. 6. §. 14.</note> eſpecially in all <hi>ſupernatural</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, where the <hi>Will</hi> can do nothing of it ſelf, but by the

                  <hi>Paragraph,</hi> thus: <hi>The Degrees of which Chriſts Love of God is capable, are by me thus expreſt, That his Love was more intenſe at one time</hi> (that is in one Act) <hi>then at another</hi> (in another Act;) <hi>but ſtill the higher of thoſe Degrees of Intenſeneſs was as truly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be in Chriſts Love at ſome time,</hi> viz. <hi>in his Agony, as the lower was at another, and ſo all the Degrees which are ſuppoſed to be mentioned of his Love are alſo ſuppoſed, and expreſly affirmed, to have been in him at ſome time or other.</hi> To make this Diſcourſe more clear and evident, I ſhall put it into form, and thus prove the former Aſſumption. If the higher of theſe Degrees of Intenſeneſs of which Chriſts Love of God is capable, was (and muſt be) as truly acknowledged to be in Chriſts Love at ſome time, <hi>viz.</hi> in his Agony, as the lower was at another, then all the Degrees which are to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be mentioned of his Love are alſo ſuppoſed, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly affirmed, to have been in him at ſome time or other, and then by conſequence it will follow, as in the former Aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But the Antecedent is true; and therefore alſo the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.

Since then that theſe Acts are the effects of the Habit, and the Habit as the Principle is only <hi>in ordine ad Actus,</hi> acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and infuſed only in order to this end, it is generally reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that as <hi>Actus ſpecificantur ab Objectis,</hi> ſo <hi>Habitus ſpecifican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ex habitudine ad Actus;</hi> and conſequently the beſt way to know the nature and perfection of the Habit will be by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the perfection of the Act.

               <p>§. 21. He then that will aſſert a <hi>Perfection</hi> and all-full <hi>height</hi> of any <hi>Habit,</hi> eſpecially in thoſe that are <hi>infuſed,</hi> to be in any Subject, he cannot poſſibly prove his aſſertion (unleſs by <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> and extrinſecal Arguments drawn from Authority, <hi>firm</hi> indeed, but <hi>inevident)</hi> except by inſtancing in the ſeveral Acts that muſt demonſtrate the in-being, and Capacity, and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Habit. He muſt ſuppoſe that if the Habit be in that Subject in all Perfection, that it is a Quality whole eſſence conſiſts in a latitude, and conſequently has in its latitude or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude (as the Doctor very Metaphyſically) ſeverall Degrees, one differing from another <hi>ſecundum magis &amp; minus,</hi> all of them comprehended in the Habit ſuppoſed to be all-perfect. For if it were a form abſolutely indiviſible, it could not poſſibly be capable of gradual perfection. And now when the Latitude of the form is ſuppoſed, he cannot prove that this form is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtent in it's utmoſt Latitude, but by inſtancing in the ſeveral Acts gradually differing in Perfection one from another that flow from this Habit, as the Doctor ha's done. And therefore ſaies Saint <hi>James</hi> 
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">James 2. 18.</note> upon this very Principle of Reaſon, <hi>Yea, a man may ſay, Thou haſt faith, and I have works: ſhew me thy faith without thy works, and I will ſhew thee my faith by my works.</hi> In vain it is for a man to pretend to have the Habit of Faith or any other Grace, unleſs he can demonſtrate it to them by the Acts, and workes, and fruits, and Effects of it. For as the ſame Saint <hi>James,</hi> 
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">James 2. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>What does it profit, my brethren,</hi> (does it any wayes advantage him? is he either the better man in himſelf, or the opinion of others?) <hi>though a man ſay he have faith, and have not works?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 22. Though then a <hi>ſuppoſed capacity of further Degrees ſeems</hi> at leaſt (and is ſo <hi>reſolved</hi> by this <hi>Refuter) to infer that theſe Degrees were not in Chriſt;</hi> yet the Propoſition which the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119243:45"/> Doctor <hi>confeſſes is not illogically inferred from his words</hi> (viz. <hi>That Chriſts Love of God was capable of Degrees, more intenſe at one time then at another)</hi> is a Propoſition neceſſary to be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by any man that by true and natural <hi>Medium's</hi> would prove the full Perfection of Chriſts habitual Grace, <hi>viz.</hi> by the fruits and effects and Acts of it, which is the only <hi>rational</hi> way of proof. And therefore the Doctor in this Diſcourſe is ſo far from any direct or conſequential denyall of the <hi>Fulneſs of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Grace in Chriſt,</hi> that he has taken the beſt way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate it. And ſtrange it is that our <hi>Refuter</hi> ſhould be ſuch an unhappy Diſputant, as to draw from the Doctors Principles the direct contrary Propoſition to that which the Doctor infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from them, and labours to prove by them.</p>
               <p>§. 23. And therefore, good Sir, I beſeech you tell us where the Doctor has let fall the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> wherewith you <hi>charge</hi> him. In what place has he ſaid that <hi>Chriſts Love of God was more intenſe in his Agony then before?</hi> Let us have you prove the Crimination, otherwiſe I aſſure you the <hi>Boldneſs</hi> will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable, although (as you ſomewhat inſolently ſay) <hi>you ſhall aſſume the liberty to fix it on him,</hi> and the <hi>ſhame muſt light on you, ſince you cannot make good your Charge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 24. It is true indeed, the Doctor ſaies that Chriſts Love was more intenſe at one time then at another, <hi>viz.</hi> in his Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and dying for us more intenſe then in his ſuffering Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Hunger for us.</p>
               <p>§. 25. And does not the Apoſtle tell us the ſame, when he ſaies, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Phil. 2. 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>That he being in the form of God, though he thought it no robbery to be equall with God, yet made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of man, and being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs; wherefore God alſo hath highly exalted him?</hi> His birth his life, his death, were all Acts you ſee of Divine Love or holy Charity: but the greater, the lower ſtill the <hi>Humiliation;</hi> the more intenſe, the more high, the more noble Act of <hi>Divine</hi>

                  <hi>Charity,</hi> both in reſpect of God and us. And therefore God alſo has proportioned his exaltation in the <hi>humane Nature</hi> to his a baſement and ſufferings, &amp; given him the <note n="(a)" place="margin">

               <p>§. 31. And this <hi>Habitual Gràce</hi> of Divine Love is ſo often acknowledged by the Doctor to be all-full and perfect in Chriſt, nay to be alwaies in Chriſt ſo full and ſo perfect as not to want, and ſo not to be capable of further Degrees, nay ſo clearly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it is by the Doctor in this very <hi>Paragraph,</hi> from
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:119243:48"/> whence the <hi>Refuter</hi> draws his Charge, that he acknowledges <hi>the but ſeeming aſſerting of that want is juſtly cenſured as preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to Chriſts fulneſs,</hi> that I cannot but wonder at the ſtrange <hi>boldneſs</hi> of the man, that though he ſaies he would <hi>aſſume</hi> that <hi>liberty,</hi> yet for all that he durſt lay that to the Doctors charge which he had ſo clearly, ſo expreſly, ſo frequently diſclaimed. But my wonder muſt ceaſe, when I conſider that from a <hi>Country-Lecturer</hi> he is arrived to be a writer of <hi>Scholaſtical and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Divinity:</hi> ſince he has attained to the <hi>Philoſophers ſtone</hi> in <hi>Theologie,</hi> and (as himſelf in <hi>effect</hi> tells us in this Pamphlet) he has all the <hi>Schoolemen</hi> at his fingers end, nay juſt as many, no more nor no leſs, then are <hi>in Paul's Church-yard</hi> &amp; the <hi>Library at Oxford,</hi> he may now conclude <hi>quidlibet ex quolibet,</hi> and by his Almighty tincture make an <hi>Ingot</hi> of a <hi>Braſs Andiron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 32. And therefore, Sir, I muſt again renew my requeſt, and deſire you in good earneſt to tell us where the Doctor does ſay, that Chriſt's Love of God was more intenſe in his Agony then <hi>before.</hi> I would you had as carefully <hi>obſerved,</hi> as you profeſs you ſhall readily <hi>hearken to,</hi> the Doctors ſeaſonable <hi>Advertiſement,</hi> that <hi>he which undertakes to refute any ſaying of anothers, muſt oblige himſelf to an exact recital of it to a word and ſyllable.</hi> I have carefully read over the whole Section, and do not find the very word <hi>(before)</hi> in it: And yet let me tell you, Sir, that this word <hi>(before)</hi> is the only ſerviceable word, that in probability might ſeem to infer that Concluſion which you lay to the Doctors charge. For he that ſaies that Chriſts Love was more intenſe in his Agony then <hi>before,</hi> does <hi>ſeem</hi> to imply that his Love did receive addition and growth in his Agony. But this the Doctor ſaies not, nay he frequently and clearly even in this Section diſclaimes it. This is only your <hi>addition,</hi> and a <hi>ſecond</hi> miſadventure in your proceedings. You had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly added the word <hi>(further)</hi> to the Doctors expreſſion, and now you will again <hi>aſſume</hi> the <hi>liberty</hi> to adde another word <hi>(before)</hi> to it, that muſt conclude the Doctor to mean and ſpeak what he never thought or intended. Sir, you are a <hi>bold man</hi> indeed. But this is only to cudgel a <hi>Jack-of-Lent</hi> of your own making. And if you make a quarrel, and deſtroy the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119243:48"/> ſhadow of the <hi>Lion</hi> which your ſelf have caſt, how can you chuſe, Sir, but deſerve the <hi>Laurel,</hi> and be cried up for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror?</p>
               <p>§. 33. But perhaps (now he is called upon for it ſo earneſtly) he will prove his Aſſumption alſo by <hi>Conſequence</hi> (for he is an excellent <hi>Sequele-man)</hi> thus; Whoſoever aſſerts that Chriſts Love of God was more intenſe at one time then another, <hi>viz.</hi> in his Agony more intenſe then in his ſuffering hunger for us, does by conſequence aſſert that Chriſt's Love of God was more intenſe in his Agony then it was before: But the Doctor aſſerts the Antecedent: Ergo.</p>
               <p>§. 34. Hold you there, Sir; your <hi>Major</hi> I deny, and there is no connexion and conſequence at all in it. For though he that ſaies, Chriſt's Love was more intenſe in his Agony then it was at another time in another Act, ſuppoſe of ſuffering hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for us, acknowledges a gradual difference in reſpect of the intenſion of theſe two ſeveral Acts; yet he does not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a gradual heightning or encreaſe of any one of them. For it is not with the intenſion of theſe Acts and Qualities that are the iſſues of the <hi>Will,</hi> as it is with thoſe that are the fruits and effects of <hi>Natural</hi> Agents. The <hi>Will</hi> here being a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>voluntary</hi> Agent, may and does <note n="(a)" place="margin">

And therefore though one of theſe Acts in compariſon of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is more intenſe, yet neither of them is therefore ſaid to be
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:119243:49"/> formally heightned and intended, becauſe being the free iſſues of the Will, they might be produced ſeverally in the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible degree of height wherein they after continued; and conſequently here is no aſſerting that Chriſts Love in his Agony was more intended (as that ſignifies a gradual heightning of the ſame numerical form or Quality) then it was <hi>before.</hi> Adde to this, that he who ſaies that Chriſts Love was more intenſe in his Agony then in his ſuffering hunger for us, does not by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence</hi> aſſert that his Love was now more intenſe then it was <hi>before,</hi> but only compare two Acts together; and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this compariſon, he may yet further aſſert, that Chriſts Love of God was more intenſe before his Agony then in it, though in his Agony it was more intenſe then in his ſuffering hunger for us, to wit, in that Act of his Love which was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately terminated in God himſelf, and in which Act of Divine Love all the reſt were radicated and planted. And indeed of neceſſity it muſt be ſo ſuppoſed. For though he loved us men, and for our Salvation came down from Heaven, and was incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and made Man, and lived and dyed for us; yet every ſtep and degree of this Love, every one ſingle Act, wholly iſſued from this high tranſcendent Act of Divine Love the moſt ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative of all, and ſtill he loved us for Gods ſake. <note n="(a)" place="margin">Heb 10. 5, 6, 7, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he ſaith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldſt not, but a body haſt thou prepared me. In burnt-offerings and ſacrifices for ſin thou hadſt no pleaſure. Then ſaid I, Loe, I come (in the volume of the Book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God,—By the which will we are ſanctified through the offering of the body of Jeſus once for all.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaies to his Diſciples that were troubled when he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told of his death <hi>(Joh.</hi> 14. 31.) <hi>But that the world may know that I love the Father, &amp; as the Father gave me commandement, even ſo I do.</hi> Though then his Love of God in his Agony and Death was the higheſt Act of Charity to us men; yet this, as all the reſt, was rooted in that higher Act of Love to his Father, becauſe they all iſſued from it, and in every Act though he loved us, yet it was only for Gods ſake.</p>
               <p>§. 35. But yet (to make our <hi>Refuter's</hi> Diſcourſe as ſtrong as
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:119243:49"/> he can deſire) I ſhall for the preſent ſuppoſe that the Doct. had poſitively and in <hi>termes terminant</hi> affirmed, that Chriſts Love of God was more intenſe in his Agony then <hi>before;</hi> what then will be the iſſue? will it then appear that he does the Doctor no wrong? and that he is able to infer his Concluſion againſt him? Certainly not. For now the <hi>Major</hi> will be proved altogether as inconſequent as the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> has already been evidenced to be falſe. It is this, <hi>He that ſaith that Chriſts Love of God was more intenſe in his Agony then before, affirmeth that his Love of God before his Agony was capable of further Degrees then yet it had. But,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. The whole ſtrength and force of it does depend and reſt upon this only Suppoſition, That any gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual heightning in the Acts of Chriſts Love muſt of neceſſity infer a gradual heightning in the Habit.

               <p> §. 45. Though then the Acts of Chriſt's Love, as immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately terminated on God, were alwaies at the height and one equall perfection (as was never yet queſtioned or denyed by the Doctor;) yet this nothing hinders but that the other Acts of this Love (of which alone the Doctor ſpeaks) regarding us for Gods ſake, might conſiſt in a latitude, and gradually differ from one another, and fall ſhort of the fervour of thoſe Acts that immediately reſpected God, as has already in ſome part appeared, and ſhall further in due place be evidenced.</p>
               <p>§. 46. And therefore this Propoſition, <hi>Chriſts Love of God was capable of Degrees,</hi> which the Doctor (in the ſenſe already given of the phraſe, <hi>the Love of God) confeſſes to be not illogical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inferred from his Paper, will</hi> ſufficiently <hi>reach the point</hi> he had in hand, without your <hi>underſtanding</hi> the word <hi>farther.</hi> For though one Act of Divine Love may in compariſon of another be more intenſe; yet nothing hinders but both may equally flow (I ſay <hi>aequè,</hi> though not <hi>aequaliter)</hi> from one and the ſame all-full habit of Charity, that is free as the <hi>Will</hi> is, and indeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in its Acts and Operations.</p>
               <p>§. 47. And therefore all the world will acknowledge, Sir, the Doctors cenſure of your <hi>adding,</hi> not <hi>ſupplying,</hi> the word <hi>(far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,)</hi> as a <hi>miſadventure</hi> in your proceeding, to be juſt, and <hi>not groundleſs.</hi>

               <p>§. 3. Put the caſe, Sir. And what will you thence conclude againſt the Doctor? Will this ever make him guilty of denying the Habitual Fulneſs of Chriſts Grace? or prove that he never aimed at the diſtinction of Love into the <hi>Habit</hi> and the <hi>Act</hi> in either of theſe Diſcourſes? Suppoſe you had not found this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction ſo clearly laid down in the <hi>Tract of Will-worſhip;</hi> me thinks, unleſs you had reſolved to be captious, it might have ſufficed you to have ſeen it in the <hi>Anſwer to Mr. Cawdrey,</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:119243:57"/> which was the Treatiſe you quarrelled at. For does not the Doctor tell you plainly, that he <hi>thought it legible enough in both?</hi> Is there no ſuch diſtinction in either Tract to be met with either <hi>in terminis</hi> or by juſt <hi>conſequence?</hi> Let us know your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive anſwer, and run not out into new Controverſies. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, though the whole that is here replied be a moſt perfect digreſſion to a matter clearly impertinent, not any waies hinted or occaſioned by the Doctor, yet I am reſolved to follow you through all this winding Labyrinth.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Thus then you return, <hi>The diſtinction which you thought legible enough before in your Tract of Will-worſhip, in which you ſay that I confeſs to find it, is ſuch a diſtinction between the Habits and Acts of Love, as that Love equally comprehends them both as Species. Now I utterly deny that there is any ſuch diſtinction in thoſe words of yours which I recite, It is poſsible for the ſame perſon to love God above all, and yet to have higher ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of that Love at one time then at another. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this my deniall is, becauſe Love as a</hi> Genus <hi>doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the expreſſions of Love equally with the Habit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 5. Well, Sir, if this be all you aim at, your reaſons might have been ſpared: It is granted as to the recital, and <hi>expreſs</hi> mention of that diſtinction in the words by you recited. But yet I beſeech you deal plainly, is it not clearly there <hi>intimated?</hi> For what ſpeak the <hi>Antecedents</hi> and <hi>Conſequents?</hi> Read you not in the two very next preceding lines this diſtinction very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>implyed?</hi> Are not theſe the Doctors words <note n="(a)" place="margin">Treatiſe of Will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>Sect.</hi> 49. <hi>p.</hi> 101. <hi>edit.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Confutation</hi> is grounded, does refer to the <hi>outward ſenſible expreſſions,</hi> and that by Chriſt's <hi>greater ardenoy</hi> in this <hi>Act</hi> of Prayer in his bloody Agony, he only meanes a more earneſt cry, and louder noiſe, and deeper groan.</p>
               <p>§. 6. But ſuppoſe we that no more had been expreſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this diſtinction then what is intimated in theſe words rehearſed, and by you acknowledged to be recited in your <note n="(d)" place="margin">Jeanes Mixture, <hi>ibid. p.</hi> 259.</note> 
                  <hi>Mixture.</hi> Yet, Sir, deal plainly with the world; can you think the Doctor a man of ſo crude, raw Judgement, as to take the <hi>outward ſenſible expreſſions</hi> for the <hi>inward Acts</hi> of Love? Or can you believe him ſo weak, as not to underſtand his own meaning? or to have loſt ſo much of Chriſtianity with his <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical preferments,</hi> as that he is not fit to be believed and truſted when he profeſſes to declare what was his own mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?

               <p> §. 7. For though it were granted (as the contrary has been ſhewed) that the Doctor in that Paſſage does only mention the <hi>Habit</hi> of Love, and the <hi>outward expreſſions;</hi> yet plain it is, that the <hi>outward ſenſible expreſſions</hi> can refer to nothing but the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Acts</hi> of Love, which (according to the Doctrine of the beſt <hi>Metaphyſicians</hi> and <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> as has been declared) the Doctor makes <hi>ſpecifically</hi> diſtinct from the <hi>Habit.</hi> For the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> of Love muſt firſt and immediately refer to the <hi>Acts,</hi> and by them to the <hi>Habit;</hi> otherwiſe your great <hi>Maſter</hi>

                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had vainly compared the <hi>Habit</hi> to a man <hi>aſleep,</hi> and the <hi>Act</hi> to one <hi>waking.</hi> The <hi>outward expreſſions</hi> in the ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate inferior Faculties muſt firſt denote the promptneſs and facility in the <hi>Act,</hi> and then this ready nimbleneſs in the <hi>Act</hi> muſt declare the perfection of the <hi>Habit.</hi> If therefore <hi>expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> be expreſſions indeed, and there be a neceſſary relation between the ſign and the thing ſignified, then the <hi>expreſſions</hi> of Love, the outward ſenſible expreſſions, muſt of neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the inward <hi>Acts</hi> of Love, of which alone they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and immediately expreſſions. And therefore we may well take the Doctors word, when he ſaies, though (in the words acknowledged and cavilled at by this <hi>Refuter)</hi> he only mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the outward ſenſible expreſſions, yet there <hi>the expreſſions, at one time and at another, muſt needs refer to the ſeveral Acts of the ſame all-full habitual Love.</hi> Which inward <hi>Acts,</hi> alone, and nothing elſe, he makes to be <hi>ſpecifically</hi> diſtinct from the <hi>Habit</hi> of Love.</p>
               <p>§. 8. But in a Parentheſis to his ſecond Argument he tells us, that by the <hi>expreſſions of Love the Doctor expounds himſelf to mean,</hi> §. 21. <hi>the outward expreſſions of the inward Acts of Love, which are termed Love only by extrinſecal denomination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 9. True, Sir. But is it with excluſion of the inward Acts? How then are they expreſſions of them? But let us view the Doctors own words in the 21. §. that our <hi>Refuters</hi> fair deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may notoriouſly appear. <hi>I muſt only ſay</hi> (ſaies the Doctor there) <hi>that is a miſ-apprehenſion: for that by loving with all the</hi>

                  <hi>heart, in the firſt place, I certainly meant the ſincere habit of Love, by love in the latter place, the inward Acts of Love, and by the expreſſions of Love, the outward expreſſions of thoſe inward Acts; and of theſe Acts only I ſpeak, and of theſe expreſſions, when I ſay they are more intenſe at one time then another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 10. But now, though it be ſo clearly evident, that in the places already quoted the Doctor by the <hi>expreſſions of Love</hi> ſtill refers to the <hi>inward Acts,</hi> which only he makes <hi>ſpecifically</hi> diſtinct from the <hi>Habit,</hi> yet this was hint enough to give our <hi>Refuter</hi> advantage to make <hi>a noiſe</hi> and a <hi>Book.</hi> He has now found new matter of <hi>Diſpute,</hi> and with might and main he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to prove that which no man ever doubted, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor never thought of. We ſhall now have <hi>Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> no leſs then a whole Page-full, in this puiſny Pamphlet, to prove that which might have been granted for asking.

               </p>
               <p>§. 11. But in good ſadneſs, Sir, why no leſs then four Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to prove that which was never denied you? Has Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> aſſerted any thing to the contrary? Did he ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that Love was <hi>univocally</hi> predicated of the <hi>Habit</hi> and the <hi>outward ſenſible expreſſions</hi> as its <hi>Species?</hi> If he has, pray quote us the place, that we may alſo confeſs and acknowledge his miſtake.

               <p>§. 12. But yet, Sir, I cannot chuſe but take notice of your Craft: you have cunningly raiſed a Cloud of Duſt, to amuſe your unwary Readers, who will think that all this while you fight with the Doctor, becauſe they ſee you ſo zealous in your <hi>Mood</hi> and <hi>Figure,</hi> and have urged no leſs then four Reaſons, backed and confirmed with two venerable <hi>Authorities,</hi> moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murely againſt <hi>No body.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>§. 17.

               <p>§. 18. I come now to your Firſt. And this though it be not altogether ſo abſurd, yet is falſe enough in conſcience. For whereas you ſay, that <hi>nothing can as a Genus be equally predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of things put in ſeveral Predicaments; but the Habit of Love and Expreſsions of Love are put in ſeveral Predicaments; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Love as a Genus doth not equally comprehend them both:</hi> Here, Sir, your Aſſumption is too infirm.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:119243:61"/> to prove and make it good, if any one inſtance can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the contrary. What ſay you now? Are not Joy and Grief and the other <hi>Paſsions</hi> of the mind frequent expreſſions of Love? <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 11. 35, 36.</note> when <hi>Jeſus, ſeeing Mary and the women weeping for Lazarus, groaned in the Spirit, and was troubled, and alſo wept,</hi> ſaid not the Jewes truly, <hi>Behold how he loved him?</hi> But now I hope you will not ſay, that theſe <hi>Paſsions</hi> of the mind are any thing elſe then <hi>Patible Qualities,</hi> and ranked in the third <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> as <hi>Habits</hi> are in the firſt. And conſequently true it is, that all the <hi>Expreſsions</hi> of Love are not (though true it is, I grant, of many or moſt of them that they are) put in ſeveral <hi>Praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments.</hi> And if ſo, your <hi>Concluſion,</hi> though moſt true in it ſelf, does not follow by virtue of theſe <hi>Praemiſſes,</hi> becauſe your <hi>Aſſumption</hi> is falſe. And ſo much for your Firſt.</p>
               <p>§. 18. Your Second and Fourth have ſomewhat in them, I confeſs, of the Face of an <hi>Argument.</hi> An <hi>argument,</hi> I ſay; For though you have ſlit it into two, and divided it from it ſelf by another what-ye-call't between, yet it differs no more then <hi>Socrates</hi> in one ſuit does differ from himſelf in another. The matter is the very ſame, though the words be different, and both the <hi>Minors</hi> depend upon one and the ſame <hi>Medium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 19. But, good Sir, let me adviſe you, that though now you have the good luck to light upon a right proof of your <hi>Concluſion,</hi> yet do not for the future obtrude your <hi>Arguments</hi> upon the world without any more confirmation then your bare <hi>Ipſe dixit.</hi> For I aſſure you, Sir, you have all-along in this Diſcourſe ſhewed your ſelf ſo unhappy a Diſputant, that even now when you have clear and evident truth in your <hi>Concluſion,</hi> men would not believe that it followed from your <hi>Praemiſſes,</hi> if <hi>Raynaudus</hi> had not been brought in to your aſſiſtance, who has ſaid more to the purpoſe in that ſmall paſſage you have quoted from him, then you have done in the whole page be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.</p>
               <p>§. 20. And yet I muſt be bold to tell you, that though <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naudus</hi> be your Friend, you do not throughly underſtand him,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:119243:61"/> and that Author in the place quoted means more then you ſeem to apprehend. Your words are theſe, <hi>Raynaudus makes menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of</hi> Gab. Biel <hi>of a diſtinction of Love into Affective &amp; Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive; and what is this Effective Love but the Effects and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions of Love?</hi> Thus you. Now the ſubject matter of your preſent diſcourſe leads me neceſſarily to underſtand your inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation of the <hi>outward ſenſible effects</hi> and <hi>expreſſions</hi> of Love. And if this be your meaning, I muſt tell you that <hi>Raynaudus</hi> is not ſo to be underſtood; and plain it is from that Author, that Love <hi>effective</hi> is not only the <hi>outward ſenſible effects</hi> and <hi>expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> but alſo ſomething elſe. For though it be true, that all the <hi>outward ſenſible effects</hi> and <hi>expreſsions</hi> of Love be Love <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective,</hi> or in plain Engliſh <hi>the iſſues and effects of Love;</hi> yet the termes are not <hi>reciprocal</hi> and <hi>convertible.</hi> For there are many <hi>effects</hi> of Love that are not <hi>ſenſible</hi> and thus <hi>external.</hi> For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, good Wiſhes, good Prayers, are the <hi>effects</hi> of true Love, ſo alſo are Joy at the wel-fare of the beloved Perſons well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Sorrow and Grief at his miſcarriage; and yet they are not alwaies <hi>expreſſed,</hi> nor does any prudent man alwaies <hi>ſhew</hi> his Joy or Grief, or <hi>expreſs</hi> his good wiſhes, thoughts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to him he moſt tenderly affects. The truth is, <hi>Raynaudus</hi> ſpeaks clear and plain to any man of underſtanding, and with him Love <hi>effective</hi> is nothing elſe but the <hi>effect</hi> of the <hi>Affection</hi> of Love. This an <hi>Imperate</hi> Act, which is the <hi>Effect;</hi> the other an <hi>Elicit</hi> Act, the <hi>Cauſe.</hi> This performed by any of the other <hi>Faculties,</hi> and is purely a <hi>tranſient</hi> Act; that an <hi>immanent</hi> Act of the <hi>Will,</hi> wherein this Love <hi>affective</hi> is ſubjected. His words as you cite them (for I have not the Author by me) are theſe, <hi>Effectivum dicit ipſum illius amoris eliciti effectum; tranſlato quippe cauſae nomine ad effectum, is dicitur amare effective qui non oſtentat infertilem &amp; ſterilem amorem, ſed cum ſe dat occaſio erumpit in fructus dignos amoris.

               <p>§. 2. And here in all this we find very little to the purpoſe, but an empty Conteſt about <hi>words</hi> and <hi>phraſes,</hi> which he carps at in the Doctor, who is a little too old to be taught the meaning of his Mother-tongue, and the uſual import of it. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I obſerve, that though he profeſs in the Cloſe of this Tongue-combat, <hi>That time is more pretious with</hi> him, <hi>then to waſt it in medling meerly with the impertinencies of any mans diſcourſe,</hi> yet he is ſo much at leaſure for all that as to ſpend the compaſs of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:119243:64"/> two pages at leaſt in his puiſny Pamphlet, upon ſome <hi>words</hi> and <hi>phraſes</hi> of the Doctors. He is a man of buſineſs indeed.</p>
               <p>§. 3. But I cry him mercy. Did I ſay it was only a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie about <hi>words</hi> this? I am afraid I was miſtaken. For <hi>he will offer to conſideration no leſs then two reaſons to prove the imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of the Doctors firſt Papers to aſcertain him of the meaning of the latter.</hi> The firſt is, becauſe the Doctor <hi>there mentions only the Habit, and the expreſſions of Love, which are called Love only by extrinſecal denomination, but here he mentions the inward Acts themſelves.</hi> The ſecond is, becauſe the Doctor <hi>now extends the Love of God, which he affirms to be capable of Degrees, beyond the outward expreſſions, unto the very inward Acts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 4. And with your Patience, good Sir, ought he not ſo to extend it? why elſe did you ſo lately blame him for not doing ſo? But what then, Sir? what then? Conclude, man, with your Ergo <hi>Pot-lid.</hi> What's all this to the purpoſe? Suppoſe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor there ſpeaks only of the <hi>outward expreſſions</hi> of Love (and yet we have clearly evidenced that he ſpeaks alſo of the <hi>inward Acts,)</hi> yet muſt not theſe of neceſſity imply and relate to the <hi>inward Acts</hi> of Love whereof they are <hi>Expreſsions?</hi> Why then could you not gueſs at his meaning in this paſſage? Can you be ſo uncharitable, as to think the Doctor was a man of ſo ſlender ſhallow parts, as to take the <hi>outward Expreſſions</hi> of Love for <hi>Love</hi> it ſelf, and a <hi>coordinate Species</hi> of the ſame <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus?</hi> If not, without doubt the Doct. muſt of neceſſity mean no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe then what he profeſſes, that beſt knew his own mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any man in the world.</p>
               <p>§. 5. The truth is, the Doctor then thought he writ to men ingenuous and candid, that would not look for knots in Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſhes. But after finding by ſad experience, that he was to deal with ſome that endeavor to move every ſtone, to throw at thoſe that are not in every thing of their Judgement, though never ſo ridiculous and falſe, though never ſo diſadvantageous to the peace and welfare of the Church; he was forced clearly to <hi>expreſs</hi> that which before he had ſufficiently <hi>implyed.</hi>

               <p> §. 6. And yet now he muſt be told, that at firſt he did <hi>mince the matter,</hi> and <hi>ſpeak more cautelouſly</hi> then afterwards, as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks indeed are wont. Before he was condemned for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too little, and now he is upbraided for ſpeaking too much. Nay our <hi>Refuter</hi> can do no leſs then to <hi>appeal to both vulgar and learned eares, whether or no we may not ſay truly of divers er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous perſons</hi> (ſuch as without doubt the Doctor is) <hi>that in the firſt broaching of their Errors they mince the matter, and ſpeak more cautelouſly then afterwards, when they are fleſhed and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with ſucceſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 7. It is readily granted, Sir, and for your further confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, I refer you to <hi>Lyſimachus Nicanor,</hi> and to <hi>Sleidan's</hi> Hiſtory of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and other true ſtories, and <hi>Paſquills,</hi> and practiſes of later times.</p>
               <p>§. 8. And now, though it be high time to leave this <hi>Tongue-Combat,</hi> yet I cannot part with this Section, without expreſſing my juſt indignation at this <hi>Refuters</hi> ſo contemptuous underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing the Doctors excellent Learning. <hi>I am very loath</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>to enter into a conteſt with ſo great</hi> a Critick <hi>touching the meaning of a word.</hi> The Doctor, in our <hi>Schoolmans</hi> opinion, is ſome petty <hi>Grammaticaſter,</hi> that knowes the meaning of <hi>Muſa,</hi> and can tell how to decline <hi>Lapis,</hi> ſome <hi>great Critick</hi> forſooth, one fit to teach Schoole-boyes perhaps the meaning of a <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latine</hi> Author: but for any skill in the <hi>Arts,</hi> and <hi>Reſerches</hi> of <hi>Philoſophie,</hi> he is a very <hi>Dunce,</hi> and not at all ſeen in the <hi>curious Speculations</hi> and Subtleties of <hi>Schoole-lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 9. And now I ſee this under his hand in print, my wonder muſt ceaſe, that he even among his <hi>Apron-men</hi> of <hi>Bridgewa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſo faſtidiouſly decries the Doctor for a <hi>Dunce.</hi> For it has been aſſured me, from very credible witneſſes, that <hi>he every where braggs, he has made this Doctor a very Dunce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 10. This minds me of the Fate of the great <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> that <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> to all curious learning which ſo brightly ſhines in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:119243:65"/> the Chriſtian world; whoſe wit, and Judgement, and induſtry, and skill, all Scholars admire, and very few equall, and ſcarce any exceed: whoſe Country-men thought themſelves ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honored in his <hi>Birth</hi> (as once the <hi>Graecians</hi> did in that of their <hi>Homer)</hi> that at the publique charge they erected a <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Statue</hi> for him, as well to their own honour as his memory. And yet this <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> whoſe Writings ſhall outlaſt ten ſuch <hi>Braſen Statues,</hi> was ſo highly undervalued by our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Lee</hi> and the <hi>Paris Divines,</hi> and ſome ſuch Pretenders to <hi>School learning</hi> as our <hi>Refuter</hi> is, as to be counted no Scholar, no Divine, but a <hi>Critick</hi> and a whiffling <hi>Grammarian.</hi> His <hi>Apologies</hi> for himſelf in this kind are ſwelled into a Volume: and in this Work he has ſhewed as much Judgement and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as in any that he ever wrote; and has clearly demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the advantage of the <hi>Critick</hi> above the <hi>Pretender</hi> to the <hi>Summes</hi> and the <hi>Sentences,</hi> and that more goes to the making a true and genuine Scholar then to rally up a <hi>Diſtinction,</hi> and to quote <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Scotus;</hi> men indeed of admirable parts, and high ſublime Judgements, and curious ſubtile inventions, and which wanted nothing but the <hi>Critick</hi> to make them more perfectly deſerve the titles of <hi>Doctor Subtilis</hi> and <hi>Doctor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 11. And therefore this Refuter has been ſo far from blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doctors reputation, that he has written a <hi>libell</hi> to his <hi>Honour,</hi> and has <hi>defamed</hi> him to his <hi>Credit.</hi>

                  </gap>, that from this <hi>Prodigy</hi> of knowledge, in whom God has ſhewed how far humane Reaſon is able to pierce into the ſecrets of Nature, both <hi>Criticiſm</hi> and <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> firſt took their beginning.</p>
               <p>§. 17. I might now ſhew how uſeful, how neceſſary the <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> and <hi>Grammarian</hi> is to compleat the <hi>Divine:</hi> But the moſt Excellent <hi>Heinſius</hi> has ſaved me that labour in the <hi>Diſſertation</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:119243:67"/> already quoted. I ſhall only appeal to all knowing and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Divines,</hi> whether the beſt <hi>Expoſitors</hi> of Scripture are not alſo the beſt <hi>Criticks,</hi> and whether ſince that kind of Learning has been in faſhion in the world, we have not known more of the obſcure, doubtful and knotty places of Scripture in this laſt Age, then the Chriſtian world was able to diſcover in five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before, and in the very height of <hi>School-learning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 18. But yet I would not be thought to undervalue this Learning alſo. I know the great uſe and Advantage of a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious skill in it. I admire at the ſtrange heights and curious ſubtilties and profound reaſonings of thoſe Doctors; and I know nothing wanting to make them the moſt admirable of men, but the true <hi>Critick</hi> and <hi>Grammarian.</hi> And he that would advance Learning to the height, muſt fix the aiery ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, that now begin to flote too much in ſome <hi>Criticks</hi> heads, with the ſolid Reaſon of the <hi>Schooles.</hi> And he, at leaſt in my Judgement, will prove the only <hi>Scholar,</hi> that judiciouſly ſtudies both.</p>
               <p>§. 19. And therefore though our <hi>School-man</hi> ſo much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue this learning, (wherein the Doctor has demonſtrated his excellence to the world in his very many writings, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in his exquiſite <hi>Comment</hi> on all the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and that other upon the <hi>Pſalms,)</hi> yet what pitty is it that ſuch a <hi>profound Doctor</hi> and ſo eminent a <hi>School-man</hi> as he is, had not alſo been a <hi>Critick,</hi> that ſo he might have truly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the import of words and phraſes that are uſed in his own <hi>mother-language?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 20. For very ignorantly he tells the Doctor, though he ſpeak it as ſententiouſly as if <hi>Seneca's</hi> Ghoſt had inſpired him, that <hi>Early cautelous ſpeaking is no Salvo unto after-unwarineſs.</hi> For though the word <hi>Salve</hi> in Engliſh ſignifie a <hi>Medicine,</hi> yet this <hi>hybridous</hi> word <hi>Salvo</hi> moſt certainly does not. Borrowed it is from the uſe and practiſe and cuſtomes of the <hi>Law,</hi> which are wont to expreſs clauſes of <hi>Reſervation</hi> and <hi>Exception</hi> with a <hi>Salvo jure meo</hi> and the like, from which and the like formes it
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:119243:68"/> is tranſlated into our Language to ſignifie a <hi>Reſervation</hi> and <hi>Exception.</hi> And this is all our <hi>Don Henrico</hi> has gained by ſpeaking Engliſh in a Spaniſh <hi>Dialect,</hi> to talk exquiſite <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe,</hi> and make his language ridiculous.</p>
               <p>§. 21. But why, I pray Sir, is <hi>Early Cautelous ſpeaking no Salvo,</hi> no <hi>excuſe</hi> you mean, <hi>for after-unwarineſs?</hi> I had thought that in <hi>Polemical</hi> writings and <hi>Scholaſtical</hi> Diſputes it had been the method of the <hi>Schooles,</hi> firſt to ſet down the <hi>ſtate</hi> of the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> and then to guide and ſteer the whole body of their Diſcourſe by that <hi>Chart</hi> and <hi>Compaſs.</hi> Though the Diſpute does multiply into never ſo much length, it is not the cuſtome of thoſe Authors to make a new <hi>ſtate,</hi> or repeat the old at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry turn, becauſe they count that done ſufficiently in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Diſcourſe. And therefore, Sir, you betray your ſelf to be no great Maſter of <hi>Methode</hi> in ſuch <hi>Eriſtical</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, for blaming the Doctor for his <hi>Early cautelous ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> which in the Judgement of all the world, that know the manner of ſuch Controverſies, <hi>might juſtly make latter caution unneceſſary;</hi> ſince all that followes in the continuation of ſuch Diſputes, by the practiſe of all writers, is only to be underſtood according to the firſt <hi>ſtate</hi> and ſetting the <hi>bounds</hi> of the <hi>Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> The Doctor indeed had not the ſpirit of <hi>Divination,</hi> nor could he foreſee what a ſubtle Diſputant he ſhould cope with: otherwiſe without doubt he would have <hi>dreamed</hi> at leaſt of the <hi>Blows</hi> and <hi>Knocks</hi> he is now <hi>expoſed</hi> to, and would as carefully have warded them.</p>
               <p>§. 22. But if his words in the <hi>Treatiſe of Will-worſhip were ſo cautious, that this ſenſe of the words you undertake to refute could not,</hi> by your own confeſſion, <hi>be affixed on them,</hi> why then is this <hi>no clearing of his Innocence?</hi> Is it not uſual all the world over, for men to expound latter doubtful ſpeeches by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer? eſpecially when ſo cautious a Repetition of a man's mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at every turn, would be ſo ridiculouſly nauſeous? Good Sir, give me a Reaſon why the <hi>Tract of Will-worſhip,</hi> wherein the <hi>ſtate</hi> of the Queſtion was firſt very punctually ſet down, ſhould not ſerve to explaine the meaning of the <hi>Account to</hi>

                  <hi>Mr. Cawdrey,</hi> ſince this laſt was written in defence of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and is nothing elſe but a Continuation of the former Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute?

               </p>
               <p>§. 23. But how is this, Sir? what? <hi>your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Confutation grounded on a Paſſage in the Doctors Anſwer to Mr. Cawdrey?</hi> I had thought, Sir, you had told us it was grounded on the 21th. §. of the Doctors <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. I am ſure, when the Doctor had profeſſed his own innocence in that paſſage by you quoted, and proved it, and publiquely renounced the Error which you then laid to his charge, you then told us, that <hi>you would charge him by Conſequence,</hi> and in the Cloſe of your firſt Argument (which makes the greateſt part of this your Reply) grounded on the <gap reason="foreign">

If you ſhould have ſaid</hi> (which he never did, but alwaies declared the contrary) <hi>that you ſpake of the Habit of Love, then you would have expreſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned the All-fulneſs of Chriſt's habitual grace</hi> (which yet the Doctor does alwaies profeſs to acknowledge;) <hi>and if you ſhould ſay, as now you do, that you meant the inward Acts of Love</hi> (as he alwaies did) <hi>why then I concluded, that you would even hereby impliedly, and by conſequence, have oppoſed the Perfection of Chriſt's habitual grace, becauſe the intenſion of the inward Acts of Love proceedeth from the intenſion of the Habit of Love, and is therefore proportioned unto it. But of this more fully in the place above mentioned.</hi>

                     <hi>The Refuters</hi> Saying <hi>is the only proof that Actual Love is in the Praedicament of Action. The contrary proved by Suarez, Smiglecius, Scheibler. In Actual love the Action and the Terminus of it conſiderable. The Refuters Remarques in Scheibler impertinent. His Oracles nothing to the purpoſe. The Propoſitions to be proved. Immanent Acts in what ſenſe Qualities. Scheibler not ſlighted. Ariſtotle his Character of Eudoxus agreeable to the</hi> Refuter. <hi>His words not home to the Refuters purpoſe, proved from Reaſon and Suarez. Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Actual Love both Qualities and Species of the ſame Genus: proved from ſundry places in Suarez. The Refuters further Impertinencies. Immanent Acts of Love in what ſenſe Diſpoſitions, in what not, from Smiglecius, Aquinas. Acts of two ſorts.</hi>

But I can preſs you with an Author far greater then <hi>Scheibler,</hi> our great <hi>Maſter Ariſtotle,</hi> of whom you make ſomewhere in your writings honorable men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

If you ſay they are <hi>habits,</hi> why then, you cannot deny them to be <hi>gracious habits,</hi> and ſo you will fall upon that opinion of which in this reply you ſo ſtudiouſly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to acquit your ſelf, viz. that <hi>the ſame habits of Grace in Chriſt may be more intenſe at one time then another, and conſequently that his habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Grace was not alwaies full and perfect.</hi>

               <p>§. 1. Whereas the Doctor had been forced again to mind our <hi>Refuter</hi> of the uſeful <hi>diſtinction</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> into it's <hi>Species, Habitual</hi> and <hi>Actual,</hi> he tells us again, that <hi>Love is not a Genus equally comprehending them as it's two Species, as he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by this argument, becauſe they are in ſeveral Predicaments, habitual Love in the Predicament of Quality, and actual Love in the Predicament of Action.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2. It is true indeed that you have <hi>told</hi> us ſeven or eight times already that this you have <hi>proved.</hi> And what pitty is it, that ſince you are a man of ſuch <hi>Gravity</hi> and <hi>parts,</hi> that we ſhould not take your <hi>word</hi> for it? But my good <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> ſince we are out of our <hi>five</hi> years <hi>Probation,</hi> give us more then your bare <hi>word</hi> for the proof of this part of your <hi>Aſſumption,</hi>

                  <hi>that actual Love is in the Predicament of Action,</hi> and not of <hi>Quality. Review your former Pages</hi> (that I may retort your own language) <hi>and tell us whether you have attempted any thing to this purpoſe. Do not then begge the Queſtion,</hi> like a <hi>Puiſny So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſter,</hi> but prove it like a <hi>Schoolman.</hi> Shall I again beſtrew your way with your own Rhetorical flowers? <note n="*" place="margin">Jeanes An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the <hi>Ecleneſt. pag.</hi> 15, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>I am reſolved as well as you to ſwallow none of your proofleſs Dictates: ſeeing I have entred the Liſts with you, you muſt not think me irreverent and ſawcy, if (as the Souldiers ſpeak) I diſpute every inch of ground with you, and be ſo bold as to call upon you for the Proof of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you aſſert touching that which is in controverſy between us. Said indeed you have often</hi> that <hi>actual. Love</hi> is a <hi>Predicamental Action,</hi> and not a <hi>Quality, but you have no where proved it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 3. And give me leave to tell you, that it will be impoſſible to make it good, till firſt you ſhall demonſtrate againſt <hi>Suarez,</hi> and the beſt <hi>Metaphyſicians</hi> and <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> that <hi>Actio, ut ſic, non dicit eſſentialem reſpectum ad terminum,</hi> and that there can be any <hi>Motion,</hi> whether <hi>inſtantaneous</hi> or <hi>ſucceſſive,</hi> and not from a <hi>Terminus à Quo</hi> to a <hi>Terminus ad Quem,</hi> and give us a ſolid anſwer to their Arguments.</p>
               <p>§. 4. And now that you may ſee that <hi>Suarez</hi> is not ſingular in this Doctrine, beſides the Authors I have already quoted to this purpoſe (for I am willing to move your Palate with a freſh Diſh) I ſhall now refer you to <hi>Smiglecius</hi> Logick, a book of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity and clearneſs in matters of this nature. He tells us, <hi>Non ſolum ſunt in corpore paſſibiles Qualitates, ſed etiam in anima. Nam etiam in anima oriuntur affectus ex paſſione &amp; alteratione corporeâ, ut ira, gaudium, timor, triſtitia, Amor,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p> §. 5. Nor muſt you be ready to take advantage, and ſay, that though <hi>actual Love</hi> be not a <hi>predicamental Action,</hi> yet <hi>Smigle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> you ſee makes it a <hi>Patible Quality,</hi> and ſo <hi>Love</hi> as a <hi>Genus</hi> cannot comprehend the <hi>Habit</hi> in the <hi>firſt Species</hi> of <hi>Quality</hi> and the <hi>Act</hi> in the <hi>third,</hi> and therefore hence at leaſt it will appear that the Doctor is miſtaken.</p>
               <p>§. 6. For the ſame <hi>Smiglecius</hi> has ſufficiently prevented this <hi>Objection,</hi> when in the beginning of his diſputation <note n="(a)" place="margin">Smiglec. <hi>Log. diſp.</hi> 11. <hi>q.</hi> 1 <hi>p.</hi> 412. <hi>Vid. etiam</hi> Suarez.

               </p>
               <p>§. 7. Nay, which perhaps will raiſe a wonder in our <hi>Refuter,</hi> I do not think but this Doctrine will alſo be found in his own <hi>Maſter Scheibler.</hi>

               <p>§. 8. Well then, in <hi>Actual Love</hi> two things may be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the very <hi>Action</hi> of loving, or the <hi>Quality</hi> of Love pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by that <hi>Action,</hi> which is it's <hi>terminus</hi> and <hi>product.</hi> Now theſe two, by reaſon of the narrowneſs of language, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under the ſame common <hi>name</hi> as other <hi>immanent Acts</hi> are: but yet though the <hi>name</hi> and expreſſion be the ſame, the <hi>nature</hi> of the things are ſo different, that they are put in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

                  <hi>predicaments;</hi> the <hi>immanent act</hi> of love conſidered as <hi>in fluxu</hi> is in the <hi>Predicament of Action,</hi> but conſidered as <hi>in termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> continually depending on the <hi>action</hi> of Love (as light does upon illumination) that produces it, it is a <hi>Quality,</hi> and in the <hi>firſt Species</hi> ranked and placed.

               <p>§. 9. But now we ſhall hear newes indeed, and he will let us know his own <hi>Remarques</hi> in <hi>Scheibler,</hi> &amp; he tells it us as grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the <hi>Romane Prieſts</hi> were wont to relate the <hi>Fate</hi> of the <hi>Empire</hi> from the books of the <hi>Sibylls,</hi> which themſelves could only read. Never any man without doubt made the like obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</p>
               <p>§. 10. <hi>There are, I know,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>divers great Philoſophers and Schoolmen that make all immanent Acts, and conſequently all inward acts of Love, to be Qualities; they are, ſay they, only Grammatical actions, not Metaphyſical actions in the predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Action. But</hi> 1. <hi>this opinion is untrue in it ſelf; and</hi> 2ly <hi>no way advantageous to the Doctors cauſe in hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 11. For once, Sir, be it granted. And what do you thence conclude againſt Doctor <hi>Hammond?</hi> I ſee you are a cunning Angler, that having fiſhed long and catched nothing, now fall to troubling the ſtream. But, <hi>En Rhodus, en Saltus.</hi> The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor made uſe of a <hi>diſtinction</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> into the <hi>Habit</hi> and the <hi>Act,</hi> which all the world, for ought I could ever find to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary approve of; and our <hi>Refuter</hi> to oppoſe it tells us, that ſome <hi>Schoolmen</hi> and <hi>Philoſophers</hi> make all <hi>immanent Acts Qualities,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>§. 12. And is not now Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> confuted?

               <p> §. 13. But, good Sir, I beſeech you tell us, what's all this to the Doctor or the preſent diſpute? Did he ever take part with thoſe <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Schoolmen?</hi> I pray what temptation had you then to run into this <hi>Digreſſion?</hi> Truly none, but that a book was to be made, and Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> to be confuted, whether he ſpake right or wrong, or ſay any thing or nothing. By this I ſee, Sir, you can anſwer <hi>Quodlibets,</hi> and <hi>Ergo</hi> you are a writer of <hi>Scholaſtical and Practical Divinity.</hi>

               <p>§. 14. But if we will but ſtay and have patience till the <hi>Sun</hi> is up, this <hi>Memnon's head</hi> will vent an <hi>Oracle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt then he ſaies, <hi>This Opinion is untrue in it ſelf; and to confirm this he ſhall offer to the Doctors conſideration two argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments out of Scheibler, which clearly prove immanent Acts to be true, proper and predicamental Actions in the Predicament of Action.</hi>

And I dare ſay, ſcarce any <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> or <hi>Schoolman</hi> of any note has for theſe hundred years al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt delivered any thing to the contrary. Why then urge you <hi>Scheibler</hi> and his reaſons, as if he, being a late writer, had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a Truth which former Authors were miſtaken in? If in the next edition of your book, or Rejoynder to Doct. <hi>Hammond,</hi> it may any way gratifie you, I ſhall refer you to Authors of a greater Bulk and larger name then <hi>Scheibler</hi> for the proof of this point. I ſhall refer you to <hi>Smiglecius,</hi> to <hi>Ruvio,</hi> to <hi>Suarez,</hi> and all the Authors they have quoted: but eſpecially I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to <hi>Suarez</hi> his moſt excellent reaſons which he has urged in the Demonſtration of it. And give me leave to tell you, that your <hi>Maſter Scheibler</hi> firſt lighted his <hi>Candle</hi> at his <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 16. That you may ſee we will not alwaies be at difference, and that it is not love of contention and victory, but Truth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:119243:77"/> that I ſtrive for, it is granted to you, and your Maſter <hi>Schei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler,</hi> that <hi>Actio immanens verè eſt actio.</hi> But then withall let me adde, that this is not the queſtion between you and the Doctor. The Propoſition you muſt prove is only this, that <hi>Actus imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentes ſunt tantum Actiones, &amp; nullo reſpectu Qualitates,</hi> that <hi>immanent Acts are only Actions, and in no reſpect Qualities. Soncinas,</hi> it is true, ſaid that <hi>Actus immanentes ſunt tantum qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litates;</hi> and <hi>Suarez,</hi> and your <hi>Scheibler,</hi> and others have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated the falſhood of that aſſertion. But then this ſaid not the Doctor, and ſo falls not under the laſh of this <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Confutation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 17. He ſaid indeed that <hi>Actual Love</hi> was a <hi>Quality ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically diſtinct from Love</hi> that is the <hi>Habit.</hi> But he never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed that the <hi>Action</hi> of loving (comprehended under the ſame common <hi>name</hi> with <hi>actual Love)</hi> was a <hi>predicamental</hi> Action.</p>
               <p>§. 18. Prove then, good Sir, if you will acquit your ſelf like a <hi>Schooleman,</hi> either 1. that the <hi>immanent act</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> in no <hi>reſpect</hi> or conſideration is or can be a <hi>quality,</hi> or 2ly that all <hi>immanent</hi> acts in general, or 3ly that this <hi>immanent act</hi> of Love in particular, has no <hi>terminus</hi> or <hi>Quality</hi> produced by it which is called by the ſame name. When you ſhall have done this, I ſhall not then blame you for ſtarting a new Queſtion.</p>

                  <hi>habitual</hi> goodneſs, but a quick and active thing, whoſe excellence and perfection did conſiſt in <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Operation,</hi> in <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>exerciſe,</hi> not in <hi>Poſſeſſion;</hi> and that <hi>vertue</hi> too, though it were in it's own nature a <hi>habit,</hi> yet it did perform nothing good, but only in the <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>operation.</hi> And both theſe he proves by this excellent reaſon, becauſe a man may be <hi>habitually</hi> vertuous and happy whilſt he ſleeps, or does any thing or nothing, even in the mid'ſt of ſufferings and miſeries and greateſt misfortunes. But they cannot poſſibly be ſo in regard of the <hi>Acts</hi> and exerciſe of vertues. And therefore

               <p>§. 30. And now, Sir, what's all this to your preſent purpoſe? Becauſe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> diſputing againſt <hi>Plato,</hi> aſſerts, as he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proved, that the <hi>Operations</hi> of vertues are not <hi>habitual qualities,</hi> but <hi>Actions</hi> placed in another <hi>Predicament,</hi> that <hi>Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> conſiſted not in the <hi>habitual poſſeſſion</hi> of Vertue, but in the <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>exerciſe</hi> of it, and that both theſe were <hi>good,</hi> though not <hi>qualities;</hi> will you therefore conclude from this place that they are <hi>Actions</hi> not <hi>terminated</hi> in <hi>qualities,</hi> or that there can be any ſuch thing, without a <hi>tranſcendental reſpect</hi> to that which <hi>terminates</hi> the <hi>Action,</hi> and is produced by it? Saies the <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> any thing <hi>Pro</hi> or <hi>Con,</hi> as they ſpeak, to this purpoſe? And yet the only matter in debate between you and the Doctor is, <hi>whether immanent Acts,</hi> ſuch as that of <hi>actual</hi> Love is, <hi>be pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly predicamental Actions, and nothing elſe, not terminated in qualities that are called by the ſame names with the predicamental actions by which they are produced?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 31. Indeed if our <hi>moral Philoſopher</hi> had here ſaid any thing to this purpoſe, he had digreſſed from his Theme into a <hi>Metaphyſical Reſerche</hi> and ſpeculation; he had been guilty of that which they call <hi>Tranſitio à Genere ad Genus,</hi> a fault which the great and beſt Maſter of Method had declared to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable.</p>
               <p>§. 32. In ſhort then, <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Felicity</hi> conſiſt not in the <hi>Habit,</hi> but in the <hi>Act</hi> and exerciſe; and being thus properly conſidered, and <hi>in fluxu &amp; operatione,</hi> they are <hi>Actions</hi> and not <hi>Qualities;</hi> and becauſe though thus conſidered they are <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and not <hi>Qualities,</hi> yet the one being the <hi>greateſt good,</hi> and the other alſo <hi>good</hi> becauſe <hi>vertuous,</hi> they muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be <hi>good,</hi> though not <hi>Qualities.</hi> And this as it was ſufficient againſt <hi>Plato,</hi> ſo it was all that the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> there intended.</p>

               <p> §. 33. But then ſecondly, becauſe theſe acts of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Felicity,</hi> as all other <hi>immanent Acts,</hi> are ſomething more then bare <hi>Actions,</hi> and carry with them a <hi>tranſcendental reſpect</hi> to the <hi>Qualities</hi> that <hi>terminate</hi> them, hence it is that theſe <hi>Acts</hi> are in this <hi>reſpect</hi> called <hi>Qualities,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Qualities</hi> are placed in the ſame <hi>Predicament</hi> with the <hi>Habits</hi> whereof they are the <hi>Effects</hi> and <hi>Acts.</hi>

Well, Mr. writer of <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtical and Practical Divinity,</hi> far more able adverſaries then your ſelf have felt the force of his Judicious pen, and found that it is not his cuſtom in any kind (though you count him no <hi>Schoolman,</hi> no <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> but a <hi>Critick,</hi> forſooth, <hi>a great Critick,</hi> nay a very <hi>Dunce)</hi> to make uſe of other mens errors to gain Credit to his own, but to ſpeak true and to the <hi>purpoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 39. But, good Sir, let us ſee how well you <hi>prove</hi> this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is to no <hi>purpoſe,</hi> that your admirers may behold what a <hi>Schoolman</hi> and a <hi>Philoſopher</hi> you are.</p>
               <p>§. 40. You ſay 2ly, <hi>Suppoſe this Opinion were true in it ſelf, yet it will no waies advantage the Doctors cauſe, for the Patrons of it range immanent. Acts under the firſt ſpecies of Quality</hi> (they do indeed, and for this you may ſee <hi>Suarez, Smiglecius, Ruvio</hi> and others;) <hi>and then they are either Diſpoſitions or Habits. If you ſay they are Diſpoſitions, as moſt of the above-named School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men hold them to be, againſt this I object, that however they may be in other men, yet they cannot be ſo in Chriſt: for a Diſpoſition carryeth in it's Notion inchoation and imperfection; and therefore to attribute it unto Chriſt is to throw an apparent diſhonour upon him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 41. Would not a man wonder you ſhould diſpute ſo grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with ſo much confidence, and yet ſo ridiculouſly? that
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:119243:81"/> you ſhould ſo often give us the ſame impertinent ſtuffe under your hand, and in Print?</p>
               <p>§. 42. Though then <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> that are in order to <hi>Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite</hi> Habits, and the <hi>Acts</hi> that <hi>produce,</hi> and conſequently <hi>precede</hi> them, carry in their Notion <hi>inchoation</hi> and <hi>imperfection</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>Habit;</hi> yet in <hi>Infuſed Habits</hi> (of which alone you and the Doctor ſpeak) as alſo in the <hi>Acts</hi> that <hi>flow</hi> from <hi>Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Habits</hi> now <hi>compleat</hi> and <hi>full,</hi> the caſe is far otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>§. 43. For <hi>Infuſed Habits,</hi> eſpecially this of <hi>divine Charity</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are <hi>immediately, ſupernaturally,</hi> and <hi>inſtantaneouſly</hi> produced by <hi>God,</hi> without any the leaſt concurrence of humane endeavour. They are all full and perfect in an inſtant. For <hi>neſcit tarda molimina Spiritus Sanctus;</hi> God and his holy Spirit, <note place="margin">Ambroſe.</note> being infinite in Power, do all things like themſelves. They <hi>but ſpeak the word, and it is done;</hi> they but ſay, <hi>Let the Habit be infuſed,</hi> and inſtantly it is created. No <hi>Acts</hi> then can <hi>precede</hi> them to <hi>produce</hi> an <hi>imperfect quality</hi> in the ſoul, to be advanced by after<hi>-Acts</hi> unto <hi>habitual perfection.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Acts</hi> that <hi>flow</hi> from them cannot, are not by any called <hi>Diſpoſitions,</hi> as that is <hi>properly</hi> taken for an <hi>imperfect inchoate thing</hi> in order to an <hi>Acquiſite</hi> Habit; but for other reaſons already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>§. 44.

                     <hi>The Doctors explication from the Refuters Conceſſions. The Refuters Reply and valiant reſolution. His firſt Charge anſwered. His ſecond Charge anſwered in three diſtinct Propoſitions.</hi> 1. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions gradually different may, and in Chriſt alwaies did, flow from a Love equally intenſe in the Habit. This not the queſtion.</hi> 2. <hi>Nothing naturally hinders but that expreſſions gradually dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent may flow from Acts of Love gradually the ſame. Proved. God's outward favours and expreſſions different. The inward Act of his Love ſtill one and invariable. Proved againſt the</hi> Socinian. <hi>Gods Love one infinite and ſubſtantial Act, againſt</hi> Crellius. <hi>In what ſenſe God in Scripture ſaid to love ſome more, ſome leſs. The doctrine of the</hi> Schools <hi>ſafer then that of the</hi> Socinian. <hi>God by one immutable Act diſpenſes all the variety of his favours. Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated. The variety in Gods outward favours: whence it ariſes. Confirmed from</hi> Lombard, Aquinas, Scotus. <hi>Applyed to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer.</hi> 3. <hi>In men the outward expreſſions</hi> ordinarily <hi>vary accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the gradual difference in the inward Acts of Love. Proved by Reaſon, and the authority of</hi> Gregory, Durand, Aquinas, Eſtius. <hi>The Doctors aſſertion hence proved as fully as the thing requires. The Doctor not engaged to prove, that expreſſions gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually different could not proceed from a Love equally intenſe. The third Charge anſwered. No myſtery in the word</hi> proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably. <hi>The correſpondence between the inward Acts of Love and the outward expreſſions to be underſtood, not according to</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetical, <hi>but</hi> Geometrical, <hi>Propoſition.</hi>

THe Doctor having now truly ſtated the Queſtion in Controverſie between him and his Adverſary, and ſhewed that the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Chriſts Love</hi> (of which alone he ſpake) were ſometimes gradually differenced one from another, and in this reſpect were capable of Degrees, though his <hi>habitual</hi> grace were not; he comes now §. 23. to explain <hi>(explain</hi> he ſaies, and not <hi>confirm</hi> or <hi>prove) this by the Refuters own Confeſſion.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>§. 4. But I find him yielding already. For he grants to the Doctor that <hi>it is an obvious Truth, that each of theſe expreſſions had an Act of inward Love, of which they were ſo many different expreſſions.</hi> I ſhall deſire him to remember it. For I doubt not but from this <hi>poor Conceſſion</hi> to prove the pertinency of the Doctors Diſcourſe, and alſo to demonſtrate before we part, that he can have nothing juſtly to reply againſt it.</p>
               <p>§. 5. In the mean while I come to give an anſwer to his three Charges he has laid in againſt the Doctor, in theſe three ſeveral Sections.</p>
               <p>§. 6. The firſt Charge is, That <hi>if the Doctor had repeated his Confeſſion full and entire, as it lay in his Book, the impartial and unprejudiced Reader would ſoon have diſcerned that there was in it nothing that made for his advantage,</hi> &amp;c. Becauſe he <hi>added theſe words,</hi> which the Doctor has <hi>omitted, and yet they</hi> (expreſſions gradually different) <hi>might proceed from a Love equally intenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 7. How pertinent this reply is, the Reader, if he will but
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:119243:85"/> peruſe your words at large, as they lie in your <note n="*" place="margin">—But of this we may ſay as he doth of Mr. <hi>Caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drey's</hi> anſwer, it is nothing to the matter now in hand. Becauſe there may be a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the expreſſions of the ſame Love for Degrees. <hi>Chriſt's death</hi> for us was an higher ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his Love of us then his <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, Hunger, Thirſt,</hi> &amp;c. and yet they might proceed from a <hi>Love</hi> equally intenſe. His argument then (you ſee) from <hi>Chriſts</hi> example will not ſerve the turn, unleſs it conclude a greater intenſion in his Love of God at one time then at another. And the falſhood of ſuch an aſſertion is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the point here handled and confirmed, the abſolute fulneſs of Chriſts grace; which by the general conſent of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Schoolmen</hi> was ſuch, as that it excluded all intenſive growth. It was a Sequele of the Perſonal union, and therefore it was from the very firſt moment of conception. The Word was no ſooner made Fleſh, but it was forthwith full of grace and truth. His Love of God was uncapable of further Degrees, unto whom God gave not the Spirit, that is, the Gifts and Graces of the Spirit, by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, &amp;c: <hi>Jeanes Mixture of Scholaſt.</hi> &amp;c. Tract. 2. p. 259, &amp;c.</note>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> will inſtantly diſcern, and that you are a moſt exquiſite <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect</hi> for a <hi>Monument</hi> of <hi>Confuſion,</hi> that thus pull down with one hand what you build with the other. For how I pray, Sir, underſtand you the word <hi>(Love)</hi> in the Clauſe you pretend that the Doctor has ſo much to your prejudice <hi>omitted?</hi> of the <hi>Habit,</hi> or the <hi>Act?</hi> if you ſay, of the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> then you make the whole paſſage in your <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Confutation</hi> to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the matter there in hand, that only concerns the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Chriſt's habitual grace.</hi> If you ſay it was meant of the <hi>Habit</hi> (as the <hi>Antecedents,</hi> and <hi>Conſequents,</hi> and <hi>Proofs</hi> from <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>authority</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>School-men,</hi> and your <hi>Subject</hi> and <hi>Title-Page</hi> confirm) then this <hi>Reply</hi> is nothing to the preſent Purpoſe, and you contradict not the Doctor, who ſpeaks only of a gradual difference in the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Chriſts Love</hi> and the ſeveral <hi>expreſſions</hi> of them. Which way ſoever you ſhall take, you cannot avoid either the <hi>Quick-ſand</hi> or the <hi>Rock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 8. The truth is, the Doctor finding this <hi>Clauſe</hi> in that part of your Treatiſe, which was deſigned to prove the <hi>allful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of <hi>habitual grace in Chriſt,</hi> he would not be ſo uningenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as not to underſtand this general expreſſion, but with <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to the <hi>ſubject matter</hi> of your diſcourſe. Your <hi>Title</hi> had proclaimed you a Writer of <hi>Scholaſtical</hi> and <hi>Practical Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> and the Doctor well knew that it was not the Cuſtom of <hi>ſuch Authors</hi> to ſpeak looſely and at random. Though in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets</hi> and <hi>Orators,</hi> whoſe aim is rather to <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>perſwade</hi> then <hi>convince,</hi> it may be pardonable to leap from one thing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:119243:85"/> and <hi>Digreſſions</hi> ſometimes may be looked on not as <hi>Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes,</hi> but <hi>Ornaments:</hi> yet thoſe <hi>Military</hi> men (among whom you deſire to be numbred) that by the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>force</hi> of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> endeavour to <hi>conquer</hi> the <hi>Judgement,</hi> and <hi>ſubdue</hi> it to <hi>aſſent,</hi> muſt ſtill carefully <hi>traverſe</hi> their <hi>Canon</hi> to the <hi>Point,</hi> otherwiſe they will prove as contemptible as the <hi>Gunner</hi> that has neither <hi>Powder</hi> nor <hi>Bullet,</hi> and like the <hi>Engineer</hi> in <hi>Kett's camp</hi> that diſcharged his Artillery over the heads of his enemies: they may fall by the <hi>Sword</hi> of that <hi>Conquerour</hi> whom they would be thought to have <hi>ſpared.</hi> I doubt not but if the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor had made uſe of thoſe words, and impoſed the ſenſe on them to your diſadvantage, which your ſelf do now give, he ſhould have been impleaded for <hi>injuſtice,</hi> and you would have managed your cauſe by clear <hi>Arguments</hi> drawn from the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedents</hi> and <hi>Conſequents</hi> in the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Confutation.</hi> But ſince you have ſhewed your ſelf ſo ill a <hi>Maſter of Defence,</hi> as by warding one blow upon the <hi>Shin</hi> to expoſe your whole <hi>Body</hi> to the ſtroke; and ſince, to acquit your ſelf from the Doctors Argument <hi>à Conceſſis,</hi> you are content to proclaim your ſelf no <hi>Maſter</hi> of <hi>Method</hi> in a <hi>Profeſſed Scholaſtical diſcourſe,</hi> and are willing, when your Argument is the <hi>Habitual grace</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to reſtrain your general expreſſions to the <hi>Actual,</hi> of which you there ſpake not; I am content for the preſent ſo to underſtand you. Nor ſhall I labour by <hi>Conſequences</hi> to <hi>rack</hi> your words, to make them ſpeak and confeſs that which you would not be thought to mean, though this has been your own frequent Practiſe all along againſt the Doctor.</p>
               <p>§. 9. But then I muſt adde that Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood you in this Paſſage according to the Current of your Diſcourſe, did you therefore no wrong in <hi>omitting thoſe words,</hi> which (in the ſenſe he juſtly conceived he was bound to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand you) did no more concern the <hi>preſent Debate,</hi> then any part of your whole Book. For it was a received and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged truth on both ſides, that the <hi>Habit</hi> of <hi>Divine Grace</hi> was alwaies perfect, and at the utmoſt height poſſible in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and therefore though the outward <hi>expreſsions</hi> were gradually diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in themſelves, it muſt alſo mutually be granted, that they
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:119243:86"/> muſt flow from a <hi>Love</hi> ſtill equally intenſe in the <hi>Habit.</hi> But then this being nothing to the preſent controverſie, which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns the gradual difference of the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's Love,</hi> it was no whit material whether he took it in or left it out, and he might juſtly uſe his freedome without any mans offence. But be your meaning what you pleaſe, I ſhall eaſily grant you the liberty, my good <hi>Sphinx Philoſophicus,</hi> to expound your own <hi>Oracles</hi> and <hi>Riddles.</hi> And what then will be the iſſue?</p>
               <p>§. 10. Why then, ſaies our <hi>Refuter,</hi> (and it is his ſecond Charge) <hi>The Doctor has ſaid nothing to prove that theſe ſeveral expreſsions could not proceed from a Love equally intenſe; Nay</hi> (as he addes in the following Section) <hi>he has not hitherto ſo much as attempted it, unleſs vehement Aſſeverations be ſolid Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>§. 11. That I may give a cleer account to this Charge, and bring the preſent debate to ſome iſſue, it will be neceſſary to diſtinguiſh. And couch the Anſwer I ſhall in theſe ſeveral Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>§. 12. Firſt then, I ſay, That <hi>Expreſsions</hi> gradually different <hi>may</hi> flow, and in <hi>Chriſt</hi> alwaies <hi>did,</hi> from a <hi>Love</hi> equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe as reſpecting the <hi>Habit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 13. But then this is not the Queſtion, and makes nothing to the purpoſe, unleſs our <hi>Refuter</hi> can prove That <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's Love</hi> repreſented by thoſe expreſſions were equally intenſe and full, as the <hi>Habit</hi> from whence they proceeded. It is true, in this Reply he does <hi>vehemently and affectionately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it,</hi> (that I may retort his own language) but <hi>pardon me he muſt, if I entertain not his vehement Aſſeverations as ſolid Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as if they were</hi> Propoſitiones per ſe notae. And <hi>as he has no where</hi> in all this Pamphlet <hi>attempted the Proof of it, unleſs begging the Queſtion be argumentative;</hi> ſo I know it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to make it good, and I have in due place demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated the contrary. And therefore</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:119243:86"/>
               <p> §. 14. Secondly, I ſay, That nothing <hi>Naturally</hi> and <hi>ab in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſeco</hi> hinders, but that ſeveral <hi>outward expreſsions</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> in themſelves gradually different, <hi>may</hi> ſometimes flow from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Acts of inward Love</hi> that are gradually the ſame.</p>
               <p>§. 15. For the outward expreſſions of Love being <hi>Imperate Acts</hi> of the Will, and under it's command, the <hi>Will</hi> is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly free, and ſtill at Liberty, unleſs it be by ſome ſuperior cauſe <hi>ab intrinſeco</hi> determined to one uniform expreſſion, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent its own <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>Elicite Acts</hi> how and in what manner it pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>§. 16. And now becauſe this may be of ſome importance in this Controverſie, I ſhall (to gratifie our <hi>Refuter)</hi> endeavour to clear it by ſome appoſite inſtances.</p>
               <p>§. 17. Suppoſe we then a Father with the ſame height of <hi>Actual love</hi> to affect his only Son, for ſome ſpace of time at leaſt. Suppoſe we the ſame Husbands or Friends to do the like, in reſpect of the Wives of their boſomes, and the inmates of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> Platonem <hi>in</hi> Convivio <hi>&amp; in</hi> Phaedro.</note> their Breaſts. We need not run to <hi>Plato's School</hi> for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; the world does daily afford us ſuch lovers as well as his <hi>Socrates.</hi> And yet no man will ſay, that theſe are alwaies bound, or do or can expreſs the ſame equal love after one and the ſame ſort, and with the ſame height and fulneſs. For ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they have not the opportunity to do it, and ſometimes <hi>Prudence</hi> enjoines them to conceal it, and ſometimes there may be a neceſſity to expreſs it beyond what they have, or indeed can do at another time.</p>
               <p>§. 18. Further yet (that I may clear it beyond exception) we know that <hi>God</hi> loves his <hi>Choſen,</hi> his <hi>Predeſtinate in Chriſt,</hi> with the ſame equal Love, not only becauſe he loves them as in and for Chriſts ſake, but alſo becauſe this <hi>inward Act</hi> of his <hi>Love</hi> is no other but <hi>himſelf.</hi> And yet Gods <hi>outward Love</hi> and favour does not alwaies ſhine on them in it's <hi>Noon</hi> and <hi>Zenith;</hi> ſometimes it looks higher, ſometimes lower: and though it

And as in reſpect of the ſame Perſon, the <hi>light of Gods Countenance</hi> is not alwaies <hi>lift up</hi> to the ſame Degree of <hi>Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;</hi> ſo it ſhines not equally on ſeveral <hi>Objects.</hi> There are as well the <hi>ſands,</hi> and <hi>ſtones</hi> and <hi>deſarts</hi> of <hi>Arabia,</hi> as the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi> and though the whole Country enjoy the ſame common <hi>name</hi> and <hi>Climate,</hi> yet all is not <hi>Felix,</hi> but ſome part is <hi>Petraea,</hi> and another <hi>Deſerta.</hi> Though thoſe that live under the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator</hi> enjoy a conſtancy of Sun-ſhine and equality of <hi>Day;</hi> yet thoſe of <hi>Lapland &amp; Finland</hi> have little elſe but <hi>night</hi> and <hi>Froſt</hi> for almoſt half the year together.

As the <hi>Sun,</hi> according to the opinion of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> though it continue ſtill fixed in one immoveable <hi>center</hi> of the world, alwaies equally projecting it's Light in an <hi>uniform Ray,</hi> yet by reaſon of the <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious poſture</hi> of the <hi>Sphere,</hi> ariſing from the <hi>triple motion</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> it makes <hi>Perigaees</hi> and <hi>Apogaees,</hi> and at one and the ſame moment diſtributes <hi>Summer,</hi> and <hi>Winter,</hi> and <hi>Autumne,</hi> and <hi>Spring,</hi> and <hi>Morn, Noon</hi> and <hi>Night</hi> to the ſeveral parts and <hi>Climates</hi> of the habitable world: So this various participation of Gods <hi>outward Love</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> ariſes not from any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and variation in the <hi>inward Act</hi> of Gods <hi>Love,</hi> but only
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:119243:91"/> from the ſeveral <hi>approximations</hi> of the Creature to God in its <hi>Eſſence</hi> or <hi>additional perfections,</hi> or as it is fitted and qualified to receive and admit a greater portion of it. And therefore moſt certain it is, that when any ſuch change is wrought, the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> varies, and not <hi>God,</hi> whoſe <hi>inward Love</hi> is eternally one, the ſame <hi>infinite and immutable Act,</hi> that has no other <hi>Object</hi> but it ſelf, alwaies loving and beloved. To make this yet more clear, I ſhall proſecute the former illuſtration. We know the <hi>Sun,</hi> according to whatſoever <hi>Aſtronomical Hypotheſis,</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues ſtill invariable in its Light, and Heat, and <hi>Influence:</hi> and yet the effects of theſe three are not <hi>uniform</hi> and <hi>equal,</hi> but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in regard of the <hi>Bodies</hi> they work on. The <hi>Starrs</hi> borrow their light from this fountain; but then becauſe they are <hi>cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Bodies,</hi> and, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> determines, of a nature <hi>Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential,</hi> they are not capable of <hi>Heat,</hi> and ſuch <hi>elementary</hi> qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and alterations ariſing from them. The <hi>Air,</hi> becauſe <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous,</hi> tranſmits its Light and Heat and Influence. The <hi>Earth,</hi> becauſe <hi>opacous,</hi> withſtands the Light, but imbibes it's Heat and Influence; and <hi>Stones</hi> and <hi>Minerals</hi> in the bowels of it are multiplyed in their kinds by them. <hi>Plants</hi> vegetate and flouriſh by them; and <hi>Animals</hi> not only encreaſe and grow, but alſo <hi>move,</hi> and feel, and perceive them. But <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>Microcoſme,</hi> being himſelf a little World, enjoyes within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf all varieties of effects to be found in any of the Creatures ſpringing from them. And yet notwithſtanding there be ſo great a difference and multiplicity of effects, this ariſes not at all from the <hi>Sun,</hi> whoſe Light, Heat and Influence is alwaies the ſame, but only from the ſeveral diſpoſitions and tempers and Perfections of the Creature, whereby they are qualified and fitted for theſe Effects and Alterations. And now becauſe<hi>—ſic parvis componere magna ſolemus,</hi> we may ſay the like of <hi>God.</hi> The <hi>inward Act</hi> of his Love, as well as his <hi>Eſſence,</hi> is alwaies <hi>one</hi> and the ſame, and all the difference in the outward effects of it ariſes from the various diſpoſition and capacity and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proximation of the Creature to him in his Being and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>irrational</hi> Creatures partake only of the fruits of his <hi>common Suſtentation</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> their natures are not capable of higher advancements. If the <hi>Carnal</hi> man
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:119243:92"/> 
                  <hi>perceives</hi> not <hi>ſpiritual Objects,</hi> it is becauſe he wants a Principle to receive them; or he wilfully ſhuts his eyes, and withdraws himſelf from the Sun-ſhine. If the <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Spirits</hi> of <hi>juſt men made perfect</hi> now ſhare not in thoſe various diſpenſations and aſſiſtances of Grace that the Church <hi>militant</hi> is partaker of, it is becauſe they are <hi>above it,</hi> and are free from all <hi>humane</hi> Changes and Alterations. If the <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>reprobate</hi> arrive not to heaven, it is becauſe it was prepared for the <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>thoſe only</hi> that <hi>fear Gods name,</hi> that carefully ſeek after it.</p>
               <p>§. 30. It is true indeed, that this variety in the ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of Gods Love and Favour, which is found in the Creature, ſprings <hi>originally</hi> from the <hi>will</hi> and pleaſure of God, which alone gives them <hi>Being</hi> in that variety and difference, that qualifies them for this ſeveral reception, and approach to him, or diſtance from him. But yet his <hi>Love</hi> is ſtill the ſame, though the <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> and Favours be thus different; as the Light of the <hi>Sun</hi> is ſtill the ſame, though the <hi>Slime</hi> be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warmed, and the <hi>Plant</hi> be. quickened from it's ſeed, and the ſeveral <hi>Births</hi> and <hi>aequivocal productions</hi> of <hi>Froggs</hi> and <hi>Inſects</hi> and the like brought forth by it, are capable of and enjoy higher perfections and advancements from it.</p>

               <p>§. 39. For in the third place, I muſt tell you, that though nothing <hi>naturally</hi> hinders but that the <hi>inward Acts</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> in <hi>Men</hi> may be gradually the ſame where the <hi>outward Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> are gradually different; yet <hi>ordinarily</hi> they <hi>are not,</hi> but the <hi>inward affection commonly</hi> varies according to the intenſion and remiſſion of the <hi>outward Expreſſions</hi> and Effects.</p>
               <p>§. 40. And hence it is, that <hi>God Almighty</hi> is very frequently in Scripture (that ſpeaks <gap reason="foreign">

Indeed this is in it ſelf ſo familiar and obvious a <hi>Truth,</hi> (ſo commonly alſo received among the <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,)</hi> that I am even aſhamed at our <hi>Refuters</hi> either Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or Folly, that he ſhould put the Doctor, becauſe he is a <hi>Critick,</hi> to prove that which every daies experience does mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to all ſorts of people.

               <p>§. 46. Indeed <hi>true Love</hi> is a very fruitful and operative thing, and it cannot chuſe but be communicative. Like <hi>Mines</hi> of <hi>Gold and Silver</hi> in the Bowels of the Earth, it manifeſts the rich treaſure by certain Signes and Indications. And though we would our ſelves, yet it cannot, will not lie hid. Every <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment</hi> laies <hi>Shackles</hi> and <hi>Bonds</hi> upon it, and ſhuts up that in a moſt <hi>tedious impriſonment</hi> which was born to be <hi>free,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long live reſtrained.

He that hath my commandements and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and manifeſt my ſelf to him.</hi> Indeed <hi>true Love</hi> does as naturally manifeſt it ſelf by the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Expreſſions,</hi> as <hi>Springs</hi> of water diſcover themſelves by the <hi>verdure</hi> of the graſs they run under.

               </p>
               <p>§. 65. And thus you ſee, Sir, that there was no <hi>Myſtery,</hi> but a <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>obvious Truth</hi> in the word <hi>proportionably.</hi> Not as if the Doctor thereby had meant, as you deſcant, <hi>that theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent expreſsions in regard of their Intenſion muſt be</hi> proportioned

For then the <hi>Act,</hi> which is the <hi>Effect,</hi> ſhould be more noble then the <hi>Habit,</hi> which is the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and there ſhould be ſomething in the <hi>Effect</hi> that was not in the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> contrary to that received <hi>Maxime, Nihil dat quod non habet, aut eminenter aut formaliter.</hi> And you know, I have already told you, that I ſpeak only of <hi>Habits infuſed,</hi> (though the reaſon be the ſame of <hi>Habits acquired,</hi> that are now <hi>compleat</hi> and <hi>full)</hi> and of the <hi>Acts</hi> that flow from them.

               </p>
               <p>§. 14. Now, Sir, I thought it had been <hi>you</hi> that had <hi>firſt quoted</hi> this place of <hi>Aquinas.</hi> And all that the Doctor had to do, was to ſhew that even that <hi>Schoolman,</hi> whom <hi>you had cited</hi> to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance your <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Confutation,</hi> ſpake nothing againſt him; for all that he ſaid, or that you quoted him for, was only for aſſerting, that Chriſt could not poſſibly <hi>increaſe</hi> according to the <hi>Habit</hi> of <hi>Wiſedom</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> which could not poſſibly concern him that ſpake only of the gradual difference in reſpect of ſome <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>holy Charity.</hi> And now, Sir, I pray tell me, does not <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſpeak fully to this, and nothing elſe? And did not you therefore <hi>quote</hi> him in your <hi>

                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:119243:107"/> And if this be ſo, then did not Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> rightly infer that this <hi>Aquinas</hi> in <hi>this Teſtimony</hi> ſpake nothing againſt him? To what purpoſe then do you <hi>divert</hi> the Reader to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, that was never in controverſie between you and the Doctor? Whether the <hi>Effects of Wiſedom</hi> in this place of <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> be either <hi>inward</hi> or <hi>outward,</hi> it is no whit material to the preſent debate. For Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> ſought no advantage by it. All that he had to prove was only this, That when <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi> and the other <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> in the places by <hi>you quoted,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied all intenſive growth of <hi>Grace</hi> and holy <hi>Charity</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they were only to be underſtood of the <hi>Habit,</hi> as they had in <hi>expreſs terms</hi> declared in the very places <hi>by you cited.</hi> As for the <hi>Acts</hi> that flow from thoſe <hi>Habits,</hi> and their intenſive per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, whether they were all <hi>equal</hi> in themſelves or gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>different,</hi> as it concerned them not in point of Argument there to determine, ſo they had ſaid nothing at all concerning them; which was all the Doctor <hi>aimed</hi> at to demonſtrate, and was ſufficient to <hi>ſecure</hi> him from your <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Confutation,</hi> that ſpake clearly of another thing then he meant.</p>
               <p>§. 15. But for the preſent be it granted that the Doctor meant to make advantage by this latter Paſſage of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and thence had concluded, that as <hi>Aquinas</hi> denied all increaſe in the <hi>habitual</hi> Grace of Chriſt, ſo he no waies <hi>denied,</hi> but <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted,</hi> a Capacity of Degrees among the <hi>Acts</hi> of Chriſts Love of God, and the <hi>Expreſſions</hi> of it, as appears from this place of <hi>Aquinas</hi> by him cited in his anſwer <hi>ad</hi> 3<hi>
                     <hi rend="sup">m.</hi>
                  </hi> For does not <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſay there expreſly, that as Chriſt increaſed in <hi>Age,</hi> ſo he did in <hi>Wiſedom</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> becauſe according to the <hi>proceſs</hi> of his <hi>Age,</hi> he did more <hi>perfect,</hi> more <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>vertuous works,</hi> and that both in things belonging to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> alſo? And have we not already cleared it from <hi>Aquinas,</hi> that ſuch as the outward <hi>Expreſſions</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> are, ſuch are alſo the <hi>inward Acts</hi> from whence they flow? and that the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Aquinas,</hi> do generally maintain from Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> that <hi>Probatio dilectionis</hi> is <hi>Exhibitio operis?</hi> If this be clear, as indeed it is, why then might not the Doctor ſay truly, that the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> of the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> was no way <hi>denying</hi> (as moſt plain it is to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:119243:108"/> any man that will read the places by you cited, becauſe they ſpeak not a word expreſly of the inward Acts) but (rather) <hi>aſſerting</hi> (for the Doctor, though he <hi>poſitively</hi> there ſpeaks, muſt be <hi>comparatively</hi> underſtood) <hi>a Capacity of Degrees among the Acts of Chriſt's Love of God and the Expreſſions?</hi> For that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi> ſpeaks plainly of a gradual difference in the <hi>Expreſſions</hi> of Chriſts Love, <hi>your ſelf</hi> do maintain; and that this by <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> implies a gradual difference in the <hi>inward Acts</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves whereof they were Expreſſions, we have alſo declared to be the opinion of <hi>Aquinas</hi> and other of the <hi>Schoolmen.</hi>

For the clearing whereof we muſt note, That there were in Chriſt two kinds of Knowledge, the one Divine and Increate, the other Humane and Created, &amp;c.—which the Schoolmen divide into two kindes; the one</hi> in verbo, <hi>the other</hi> in genere proprio; <hi>that is, the one in the eternal Word, wherein he ſeeth all things, the other, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſeeth things in themſelves, &amp;c.—Concerning his Divine Knowledge, the Perfection of it was ſuch and ſo infinite from all eternity, that it is impious once to think that he grew and increaſed in the ſame.</hi>

For they have no degrees at all, but <hi>ſecundariò,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Habit of his Love: but now this Objection is urged by you againſt the perpetual all-fulneſs and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his actual Love, the inward Acts of his Love; for it is brought to prove, that the inward Acts of Chriſts Love were more intenſe at one time then another, and a greater intenſion preſuppoſeth a remiſſion and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for <hi>intenſio eſt eductio rei intenſae de imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto ad perfectum,</hi> as <hi>Aquinas</hi> very often.

                  </gap>, and the Doctors <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion</hi> will by no means <hi>inferr</hi> your <hi>Concluſion?</hi> For proof of it, I firſt deny your <hi>Major;</hi> there is no <hi>conſequence</hi> at all in it: for we have already demonſtrated, that <hi>Acts</hi> which iſſue from <hi>Habits</hi> that are ſeated in the <hi>Will</hi> are <hi>free,</hi> and not <hi>neceſſary</hi> effects of the <hi>Will</hi> from whence they flow, and therefore may be gradually different in themſelvs, where the <hi>Habit</hi> continues gradually one and the ſame. We have ſhewed you alſo from Reaſon and Scripture, and Authority of Proteſtants and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, as learned as any, from Schoolmen and Fathers alſo, that there was a gradual difference in ſome <hi>Acts</hi> of Chriſts <hi>Wiſedom</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> and that they did <hi>ſucceſſively</hi> increaſe in <hi>Perfection,</hi> as he himſelf did in <hi>Stature,</hi> though the <hi>Infuſed Habit</hi> of <hi>Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> were in him alwaies at the utmoſt height, both intenſively and extenſively.</p>
               <p>§. 7. But what are all the Fathers and Schoolmen that are to be had in <hi>Paul's Church-yard</hi> or in the <hi>Library at Oxford</hi> to the purpoſe, if he can prove his <hi>Major?</hi> which thus he does. <hi>If the degrees of the</hi> inward Acts <hi>of Chriſts Love are commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate unto the degrees of his</hi> habitual Love, <hi>then whoſoever ſaies the</hi> Acts <hi>are not alwaies intenſively perfect, ſaies alſo by conſequence that the.</hi> Habit <hi>is not alwaies intenſively perfect.

               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:119243:122"/>
               <p> §. 8. Here, Sir, you are in <hi>danger</hi> of a double <hi>Sophiſm.</hi> For firſt, you prove <hi>Ignotum per ignotius, aut aliquid ſaltem aeque ignotum,</hi> becauſe it is as doubtful (in the ſenſe you ſhould mean, if you ſpeak to the preſent purpoſe) whether the <hi>degrees</hi> of the <hi>inward Acts</hi> of Chriſts <hi>Love</hi> are ſo commenſurate unto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of his <hi>habitual</hi> Love, as ſtill to <hi>equal</hi> them in intenſive perfection; and to aſſert it without Proof is <hi>Sophiſma</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Secondly, if you conclude that the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Habits</hi> are <hi>commenſurate</hi> in <hi>every thing,</hi> becauſe they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate in this, that the <hi>Act</hi> can never <hi>exceed</hi> in <hi>Perfection</hi> the <hi>Habit</hi> from whence it effectively flowes, (as you do all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in this Diſcourſe, but more particularly in your firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, p. 25, 26.) you moſt <hi>ſophiſtically</hi> argue <hi>à dicto ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum quid ad dictum ſimpliciter.</hi> For though the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Chriſts Love</hi> may be full and perfect <hi>in ſuo genere,</hi> yet they may not be all <hi>equal</hi> in <hi>themſelves,</hi> and with the <hi>Habit:</hi> and though they may and muſt be commenſurate with the <hi>Habit,</hi> as not to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed</hi> it in perfection, becauſe they are the <hi>effects</hi> of the <hi>Habit;</hi> yet they may not, for all that, ſtill <hi>equal</hi> the gradual perfection of the <hi>Habit,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Habit</hi> is not a <hi>neceſſary,</hi> but a <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> cauſe, and the <hi>Acts</hi> that flow from it are all <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Will.</hi> And conſequently this way of proof will be no other then a plain <hi>Sophiſm</hi>

               </p>

               <p>§. 10. But, Sir, what is that which you have proved? Is it this, That all the <hi>inward Acts</hi> of Chriſt's Love are <gap reason="foreign">

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> himſelf for cunning. Thus it is. If the <hi>inward Acts</hi> of Chriſts Love have no Degrees at all, but <hi>ſecundariò</hi> in regard of the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit</hi> of Love, then the <hi>inward Acts</hi> of his Love of God are commenſurate unto the degrees of his <hi>habitual</hi> Love. But they have no Degrees at all, &amp;c. Ergo. Lo now; here is a <hi>For,</hi> able to prove any <hi>Becauſe</hi> whatſoever. It is able to make good contradictions, and make the two extremes of the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Southern Poles</hi> to meet. They are commenſurate in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual perfection with the <hi>Habit,</hi> which is as <hi>high</hi> and <hi>intenſely perfect</hi> as can poſſibly be imagined, beyond all the perfections of <hi>all men</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> though <hi>united</hi> and <hi>joyned</hi> together; and conſequently they are <hi>ab intrinſeco</hi> all full and intenſively per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. And yet in the <hi>Antecedent</hi> that is brought for a proof of it it is ſaid, that they have no Degrees at all in themſelves, but <hi>ſecundariò</hi> in regard of the <hi>Habit,</hi> which is only <hi>ab extrinſeco.</hi> Sir, you have an admirable faculty in diſcourſe. For what with your <hi>ipſe dixit's,</hi> and your proving of one Contradictory by another, you are able to demonſtrate any thing, and confute not only Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> but the whole world of <hi>Criticks.</hi> For if the <hi>Acts</hi> have no Degrees at all, but only <hi>ſecundariò</hi> in regard of the <hi>Habit,</hi> how then are they commenſurate to the <hi>Habit</hi> in Degrees, that is gradually perfect in it ſelf? And thus you ſee your <hi>Sequele</hi> wants another <hi>For</hi> to make it good; and ſo it will be, Sir, in ſuch <hi>Sequeles,</hi> though you go on <hi>in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> Where one <hi>unknown</hi> is proved by another, there the proofes muſt ſtill be endleſs.</p>
               <p>§. 11. And therefore, to proceed on to examine your <hi>For,</hi> upon which the whole ſtrength of your Proof depends, How
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:119243:123"/> know you that the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Chriſts Love</hi> have no Degrees, but <hi>ſecundariò</hi> in regard of the <hi>Habit</hi> of his Love? 1. Is it becauſe being commenſurate with the <hi>Habit,</hi> they are alwaies in one height and indiviſible perfection? But then this, as it is no other then <hi>Petitio principii,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſo if it were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it muſt prove that they have all gradual perfection in them, as the <hi>Habit</hi> has. 2. Or is it, that they have no Degrees at all, but <hi>ſecundariò</hi> in regard of the <hi>Habit</hi> of love, becauſe the <hi>Acts</hi> effectively flow from the <hi>Habit?</hi> But will you therefore conclude that a <hi>hot Iron</hi> has no Degrees of Heat in it, but only <hi>ſecundariò</hi> in regard of the <hi>Fire,</hi> becauſe it's Heat proceeds not from it ſelf, but only from the Fire? Has it not Heat in it ſelf, becauſe not from it ſelf? Sir, you had been an excellent man to have preached in old time before a <hi>Trial</hi> by fire <hi>Ordeal.</hi> But then let me tell you, Sir, that as your <hi>Minor</hi> in this ſenſe is falſe, ſo the whole is a <hi>Sophiſm à non cauſa pro cauſa.</hi> For as the <hi>Iron</hi> is <hi>formally</hi> and ſo gradually hot in it ſelf, though <hi>effectively</hi> it be not the cauſe of its own Heat; ſo the <hi>Acts</hi> of Chriſts Love are <hi>formally</hi> Love, and have a gradual perfection in them, though the <hi>Acts</hi> all proceed from the <hi>Habit</hi> of <hi>Divine Love.</hi> 3. Or is it, that they have no Degrees at all but only <hi>ſecundariò,</hi> becauſe <hi>Actions</hi> (among which you range the <hi>immanent Acts</hi> of Love) are only thus intended? If this be your meaning, I muſt tell you that you are guilty of a <hi>double</hi> Miſtake. For firſt, we have ſhewed that the <hi>immanent Acts</hi> of Love are not only <hi>Actions,</hi> but <hi>Qualities,</hi> that are called by the ſame common name, of which alone the Doctor ſpeakes. And ſecondly, I muſt tell you that <hi>Actions</hi> (ſuppoſing the <hi>immanent Acts</hi> of Love were purely of that number) are not ſaid to be thus intended in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the <hi>Efficient,</hi> but only in regard of their <hi>Termes</hi> or <hi>Qualities;</hi> as ſhall inſtantly be ſhewed both from <hi>Suarez</hi> and <hi>Scheibler.</hi> For here we take not <hi>Intenſion effectivè,</hi> but <hi>forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter;</hi> which diſtinction you may alſo learn from <hi>Scheibler.</hi> l. 2. Metaphyſ. c. 8. §. 191.</p>
               <p>§. 12. And therefore now to let the world ſee your <hi>profound</hi> skill in <hi>Metaphyſicks,</hi> I ſhall demonſtrate that the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Chriſts Love</hi> were <hi>primariò &amp; per ſe,</hi> and not only <hi>ſecundariò</hi>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:119243:123"/> and <hi>per accidens,</hi> capable of Degrees. And thus I perform it. All <hi>Qualities</hi> whoſe <hi>Eſſence</hi> conſiſts not in an indiviſible point, but in a <hi>Latitude,</hi> are <hi>primariò, per ſe &amp; eſſentialiter</hi> capable of Degrees: But all <hi>Habits</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> that <hi>effectively</hi> flow from them are <hi>Qualities</hi> whoſe <hi>Eſſence</hi> conſiſts not in an indiviſible point, but in a <hi>Latitude:</hi> Ergo. The <hi>Major</hi> is evident in it ſelf; for <hi>Intenſio propriè ſumitur pro Latitudine, ſeu modo Entitatis formae intenſibilis &amp; remiſſibilis, ratione cujus eſt capax illius intenſionis &amp; remiſſionis.</hi> So <hi>Suarez</hi> Metaph. tom. 2. diſp. 46. p. 380. col. 1.

To this I ſhall ſubjoin the <hi>very words</hi> upon which the <hi>Refuter</hi> grounds his Charge in the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Confutation,</hi> §. 5. of that Section. <hi>But ſure this anſwer is nothing to the matter now in hand, for the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing of which that example of Chriſt was brought by me, viz.</hi> That ſincere Love is capable of Degrees. <hi>This was firſt ſhewed in ſeveral men, and in the ſame man at ſeveral times, in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ranks of Angels, and at laſt</hi> in Chriſt <hi>himſelf, more ardent in one</hi> act of Prayer <hi>then in another, wherein what is affirmed of Chriſt is common to Angels and Men,</hi> &amp;c. And now I appeal to our <hi>Refuter</hi> himſelf, and deſire him to tell me, whether the Doctor can poſſibly mean any thing elſe by this Phraſe, <hi>the Love of God,</hi> and <hi>ſincere Love,</hi> in theſe places, then the grace of holy <hi>Charity,</hi> that in its <hi>general comprehenſive notion</hi> contains in it whatſoever is <hi>holy, good,</hi> or <hi>vertuous</hi> for <hi>kind</hi> or <hi>degree,</hi> that the Chriſtian out of a <hi>ſincere Love</hi> to God either <hi>freely</hi> or by way of <hi>Duty</hi> performs? Can he poſſibly here mean by <hi>Chriſts Love of God</hi> in theſe places, that <hi>Beatifick Love of God</hi> which was alwaies <hi>in termino,</hi> and was proper to him as <hi>Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor?</hi> Does he not expreſly adde, in the <hi>Cloſe</hi> of thoſe words, that <hi>what herein is affirmed of Chriſt, is common to Angels and Men?</hi> And do not his ſeveral <hi>inſtances</hi> ſpeak as much? Let our <hi>Refuter</hi> himſelf judge, what other <hi>Love</hi> can the Doctor mean, that is <hi>common</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> except that <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> which the Doctor conſtantly makes a <hi>Genus</hi> to <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual</hi> and <hi>actual Love?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 29. That this, and no other, was the Doctors meaning, will 2ly appear from Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi>'s <hi>Reply,</hi> and the Doctors <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi> to it, §. 2. For whereas the Doctor had affirmed that <hi>this Grace of holy Love (or Divine Charity) conſiſted in a ſincere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after perfection;</hi> Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> now returns that it <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in an abſolute ſinleſs Perfection, ſuch as was that of</hi> Adam <hi>in innocence, and therefore perfect Love, ſuch as did caſt out fear,</hi> 1 Jo. 4. 18. Now to this the Doctor returns, 1. that <hi>that perfect</hi>

                  <hi>Love of</hi> Adam <hi>in innocence conſiſted not in an indiviſible point in the ſeveral Acts;</hi> 2ly, <hi>that S.</hi> John<hi>'s Love was not that of</hi> Adam <hi>in innocence, which is confeſſed not to be attainable, but that other which is in every</hi> Confeſſor <hi>and</hi> Martyr, <hi>which is called</hi>

               <p>§. 30. Thirdly, this appears from the ſeveral <hi>Acts</hi> the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>inſtances</hi> in that conſiſted in a <hi>Latitude;</hi> the <hi>Love of</hi> Adam in innocence; the <hi>Zeal</hi> of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Confeſſors</hi> for <hi>Chriſt</hi> in their patience and ſufferings; the <hi>ardency</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in ſeveral <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>Prayer;</hi> the different <hi>ardency</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> in other men, which he acquits from ſin by the example of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and laſtly by ſeveral <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Liberality</hi> to the <hi>poor.</hi> All which as it is plain they are <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>infuſed Grace</hi> of holy <hi>Charity,</hi> all rooted in that high ſublime <hi>Love</hi> immediately <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred</hi> in <hi>God</hi> himſelf, ſo clear it is that they are not <hi>that Love</hi> as thus <hi>ſpecially</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> taken, but rather <hi>fruits</hi> and <hi>expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>§. 31. Laſtly, this will appear from <hi>expreſs words</hi> in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, §. 5. of that Section, thus; <hi>Still it muſt be remembred,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>that it is not the ſinleſs Perfection we ſpeakof, when we ſay it conſiſts in a Latitude, and hath Degrees, but Sincerity of this or that vertue,</hi> (I pray mark it, good Sir,) <hi>expreſt in this or that performance: and as this, though it excludes not all mixture of ſin in the</hi> Suppoſitum <hi>(the man in whom it is) yet may by the grace of God in Chriſt exclude it in this or that</hi> Act <hi>(for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that I may in an</hi> act <hi>of</hi> Mercy (mark it again) <hi>give as much as any law obligeth me to give, and ſo not ſin in giving too little;) ſo to this his anſwer belongs not at all, nor ſhewes any difference or reaſon, why ſuch Sincerity may not in any pious Chriſtian be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Degrees as well as in Chriſt himſelf,</hi> (I pray, good Sir, mark it) <hi>and the lower of them be ſinleſs, and all the ſuperiour</hi> voluntary oblations <hi>more then</hi> the ſtrict Law <hi>required of us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 32. And thus alſo was the Doctor underſtood by Mr. <hi>Caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drey</hi> in his inſtance in Chriſt himſelf. For whereas the Doctor had urged, <hi>he was more intenſe in Praier at one time then another,</hi>

                  <hi>when yet the lower degree was no ſin;</hi> to this Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> anſwers, <hi>That Chriſt was above the Law, and did more then the Law of God required, but men fall ſhort many degrees of what is required.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 33. Nay the Doctor was underſtood in this ſenſe by the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Mixture of Scholaſtical and Practical Divinity</hi> himſelf. For whereas his <hi>Theme</hi> had been the All-fulneſs of <hi>habitual Grace</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> from pag. 230. to 256. he there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to draw out four <hi>

It was a ſequele of the perſonal u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and therefore it was from the very firſt moment of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. The Word was no ſooner made Fleſh, but it was forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with full of Grace and Truth.

               </p>
               <p>§. 34. Indeed, as it had been nothing to that Authors pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and his <hi>

               <p>§. 35.

               <p>§. 47.

                  <q>Si attendatur gradus in Charitate ſecundum intenſionem &amp; remiſſionem Actus volendi, Sic dicendum eſt, quod talis ordo eſt in Charitate, quia intenſiùs tenemur dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere Deum quam nos ipſos; et majus bonum debemus nobis magis velle vel proximo, quam minus bonum; ſic aequale bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num magisnobis quam proximo, caeteris paribus.

Secundo, poteſt argui ex altera clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula dicti Ariſt. Unicuique eſt amabile bonum proprium. Sed quod eſt bonum mihi eſt magis proprium quam illud quod eſt proximi: quia licet proximus ſit alter ipſe, non tamen eſt Ego ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, ſed alter. Ergo aequale bonum debeo mihi magis diligere &amp; optare quam proximo; &amp; ita, quod ſi ambo non poſſemus habere, plus debeo eum velle carere quam me: quod eſt intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligendum ſemper caeteris omnibus exiſtentibus paribus.

               <p>§. 65. From hence I thus argue:</p>

               <p>But the <hi>efficacious Acts</hi> of <hi>Chriſts Love</hi> and <hi>holy Charity</hi> were moſt perfect, the <hi>inefficacious Acts</hi> of the ſame <hi>holy Love</hi> were imperfect. Ergo</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>holy Love</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> were gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſtinguiſhed, and <hi>ſecundum magis &amp; minus</hi> different one from another.

               </p>
               <p>§. 69. From whence further it ſeems (to me at leaſt) moſt unavoidably to follow, that though by that prime <hi>fundamental law</hi> of <hi>Divine Charity</hi> we are bound to <hi>love God with all our heart, with all our ſoul, and with all our mind;</hi> yet this only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges us to love him ſo, as to prefer nothing before or above him, ſo as in every <hi>Act</hi> we deſire nothing but what is holy, juſt and honeſt, and <hi>quoad ſpecificationem,</hi> as they ſpeak, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to his holy <hi>Will,</hi> as himſelf has revealed in his holy lawes and precepts, and what alſo tends to his honour and glory; and not in every <hi>Act pro hîc &amp; nunc &amp; quoad exercitium,</hi> as they ſpeak, to the moſt high, moſt noble and intenſe degree of holy <hi>Charity.</hi> For otherwiſe I ſee not how theſe <hi>inefficacious conditionate deſires</hi> of our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> can be excuſed from the breach of this Law, becauſe they had neither the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble immediate material <hi>Objects,</hi> nor were ſo gradually intenſe as other <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>holy Charity</hi> were. And yet moſt aſſured we are, that all his deſires and inclinations, as well as his actions, were holy, juſt and good, and conformable to <hi>Gods Will,</hi> and were the true and genuine fruits of the <hi>Habit</hi> of <hi>Divine Grace.</hi> But now moſt certain it is, that though he came into the world for none other end then to reconcile the world unto his Father by his Death, though he had received an expreſs <hi>command</hi> from him, and alſo voluntarily <hi>contracted</hi> and <hi>covenanted</hi> with him, to perform it, and though it was in it ſelf the moſt high and tranſcendent <hi>Act</hi> of holy <hi>Charity</hi> to his neighbour imaginable; yet for all that he <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>really,</hi> and not in <hi>ſhew</hi> and <hi>comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> only, declined the bitter cup, though ſtill with ſubmiſſion to Gods will. For firſt, he prayed not only <hi>prolixius,</hi> but <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſius</hi> alſo, as ſhall in due place be proved; he prayed <hi>thrice,</hi> and he prayed alſo more <hi>Ardently</hi> then at other times, for the removal of this <hi>bitter Cup:</hi> the apprehenſion of the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing torment and the horror of his Fathers wrath made his <hi>ſoul ſorrowful</hi> even to <hi>Death,</hi> and it caſt him into ſuch an <hi>Agony,</hi> that he ſweat <hi>great drops</hi> of <hi>blood</hi> through his cloathes <hi>down to the</hi>

All which in every part ſhall be fully demonſtrated in due place.</p>
               <p>§. 70. From all which thus conſidered I thus argue:</p>
               <p>That if our Saviour did <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>innocently,</hi> becauſe <hi>natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> deſire the removal of that <hi>bitter Cup,</hi> though with ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Fathers will, even when ſo high an <hi>Act</hi> of divine <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> as the reconciling of the <hi>world</hi> to God by his death lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes, and his Father had given him a <hi>command</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, and he himſelf <hi>came</hi> for no other <hi>end</hi> into the world then to make it good; then he might as <hi>innocently</hi> have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by all lawful means his ſelf-preſervation, upon ſuppoſal that no ſuch <hi>Covenant</hi> had been made, nor particular <hi>command</hi> given, and God had left it <hi>freely</hi> in his <hi>power</hi> either to reconcile the world to him by his death, or to endeavour by juſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent waies to ſave himſelf. For plain it is from Scripture, that before his <hi>hour</hi> was come which <hi>the Father</hi> had <hi>appointed</hi> for this work, when the <hi>Jewes</hi> took up ſtones to <hi>ſtone</hi> him, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelf, to leave us an <hi>example</hi> what we might lawfully do in ſuch caſes. And hence it is, from the <hi>Authority</hi> of this great <hi>example,</hi> that though <hi>Martyrdome</hi> be the higheſt and moſt ſublime <hi>Act</hi> of Chriſtian <hi>Charity,</hi> yet all men that profeſs the name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are not by virtue of that firſt great <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental law</hi> of divine <hi>Charity, Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and all thy mind,</hi> obliged in a time of <hi>Perſecution</hi> to offer themſelves to <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>fagot,</hi> but lawfully may embrace a <hi>leſſer good,</hi> and follow a leſs <hi>noble Act</hi> of <hi>Charity,</hi> conſiſting in a lawful endeavour of their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, even when an <hi>occaſion</hi> offers of glorifying God by their ſuffering <hi>death</hi> or <hi>perſecution</hi> for his names ſake. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had <hi>ſinned,</hi> when he <hi>was let down from the wall in a Basket.</hi> otherwiſe the <hi>Martyriani,</hi> that ſo eagerly coveted <hi>Martyrdome</hi> for Gods honour, had been the beſt of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and are unjuſtly branded with the name of <hi>Hereticks;</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullians</hi>

               </p>
               <p>§. 71. From all which it ſeems to me clearly to follow, that (as the Doctor aſſerts) <hi>ſincere Love</hi> in the <hi>Habit</hi> is capable of Degrees in the ſeveral <hi>Acts, either in one man at ſeveral times, or in two men at the ſame time, and ſo both may obey</hi> that firſt great <hi>Precept of Loving God with all the heart,</hi> in reſpect of ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Acts</hi> that are gradually different. For though that <hi>Act</hi> that is leſs intenſe is <hi>comparatively</hi> leſs perfect, yet is it not therefore ſo farre <hi>faulty</hi> or <hi>in vitio:</hi> becauſe God commands <hi>ſincerity</hi> of our Love, which is capable of Degrees in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Acts,</hi> as <hi>occaſion</hi> offers, and not alwaies <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc</hi> the higheſt and moſt noble <hi>Act</hi> of holy <hi>Charity,</hi> as appears by theſe ſo great examples.</p>
               <p>§. 72. If it here be ſaid, that our Saviour <hi>prayed</hi> for a <hi>removal</hi> of this bitter <hi>Cup</hi> with <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to his Fathers <hi>will,</hi> which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters much the Caſe:</p>
               <p>§. 73. I grant he did ſo; but then I further argue, that if it had not otherwiſe been lawful <hi>(praeſcinding</hi> ſtill from Gods <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree</hi> in the preſent caſe) but the great <hi>fundamental law</hi> of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> (without any other <hi>expreſs</hi> and <hi>poſitive command</hi> of Gods, for the laying down his life) had obliged him to it, he could not have been excuſed, though he did deſire the <hi>removal</hi> of it with <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide</hi> Hooker. <hi>Eccleſiaſt. Pol. l.</hi> 5. §. 48. <hi>p.</hi> 280.</note> 
                  <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to his Fathers <hi>will.</hi> For what I may not lawfully <hi>perform</hi> and <hi>do</hi> as in it ſelf conſidered, that I cannot lawfully <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> for, though with <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to Gods <hi>will.</hi> For ſhall I pray to God to <hi>bleſs</hi> me in an <hi>unlawful Act,</hi> ſuppoſe of <hi>Murder</hi> or <hi>Adultery,</hi> becauſe I deſire it only with <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to Gods <hi>will?</hi> They muſt be only <hi>innocent, holy</hi> things we muſt <hi>ask</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> for from the moſt <hi>holy</hi> God; and ſtill we muſt <hi>ask</hi> them too with a <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to his holy <hi>will</hi> and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>§. 74. And as this was all the Doctor aimed to prove by that
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:119243:139"/> inſtance of our Saviours greater <hi>Ardency</hi> in this <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>prayer</hi> then in another; ſo we ſhall have anon occaſion to clear and further vindicate that inſtance.</p>
               <p>§. 75. I might in the third place demonſtrate this <hi>Truth</hi> from the conſideration of the gradual difference, in reſpect of intenſion, between the <hi>neceſſary Acts</hi> of holy <hi>Charity</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Acts</hi> to which his <hi>Will</hi> had a moſt <hi>abſolute freedome.</hi> For moſt certain it is, that in the <hi>prime</hi> and moſt noble <hi>Act</hi> of Divine Charity, that was immediatly terminated in <hi>God</hi> the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, he did love <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> and to the utmoſt height of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion imaginable, and he did alwaies ſo love him; nor could he poſſibly do otherwiſe, becauſe being alwaies <hi>Comprehenſor,</hi> as they ſpeak, he perfectly knew him, and his <hi>Love</hi> muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be <hi>exactly commenſurate</hi> to his <hi>Knowledge.</hi> For even the great <hi>Philoſopher</hi> by the light of Reaſon could diſcover, that <hi>Summum bonum</hi> and <hi>finis ultimus neceſſariò amatur.</hi> And then as certain it is, that in other <hi>Acts</hi> of holy <hi>Charity</hi> he did not love <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> but <hi>freely,</hi> and his Will had an <hi>abſolute free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> in them, and by reaſon of this <hi>freedome</hi> and <hi>liberty</hi> in the <hi>performance</hi> of the <hi>Acts,</hi> he was capable of <hi>meriting</hi> by them. And for this our <hi>Refuter</hi> himſelf ſaies, that if you pleaſe, you may ſee further in <hi>Suarez in tertiam partem Thomae,</hi> diſt. 39. <note place="margin">Jeanes <hi>Reply to the Ectene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteron, p.</hi> 39.</note> ſect. 4. where the queſtion is debated, <hi>Quomodo voluntas Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti ex neceſſitate diligens Deum, in reliquis actibus potuerit eſſe libera.</hi> But becauſe our <hi>Refuter</hi> has miſtaken that <hi>Author,</hi> and he will give us a fitter opportunity of handling this Argument, I ſhall defer the further proſecution of it till that Section.</p>
               <p>§. 76. And ſo I come at laſt to the examination of the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption</hi> of your <hi>monſtrous Syllogiſm.</hi> It is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But now this Objection is urged by you againſt the perpetual All-fulneſs and perfection of his actual Love, the inward Acts of his Love. For it is brought to prove that the inward Acts of Chriſts Love were more intenſe at one time then at another; and a greater intenſion preſuppoſeth remiſſion and imperfection; for</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſio eſt eductio rei intenſae de imperfecto ad perfectum, <hi>as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas very often.</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:119243:139"/>
               <p> §. 77. Before I come to conſider the ſtrength of this <hi>Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> it will not be amiſs to mind the Reader of a known <hi>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> to avoid all <hi>Cavils</hi> for the future, by reaſon of a <hi>Term</hi> therein that may be <hi>ambiguouſly</hi> conſtrued, and it is the <hi>Term Actual Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For ſometimes it is taken for that which is oppoſed to <hi>Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Love;</hi> and then it denotes the <hi>Operation</hi> and the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> and is no other then that which they call <hi>Actus ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> in the <hi>Schools,</hi> or that <hi>Love</hi> which is in <hi>Actu ſecundo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then ſecondly, it is ſometimes taken for that which is oppoſed to <hi>potential Love,</hi> to that which is yet <hi>incauſis</hi> and <hi>in fieri,</hi> as they ſpeak, and not <hi>in eſſe;</hi> and then it denotes only the <hi>exiſtence</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> and it is the ſame with the <hi>Habit of Love,</hi> and that which they call <hi>Actus primus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 78. If now the term <hi>Actual Love</hi> be taken for that <hi>Love</hi> which is only <hi>in Actu primo,</hi> and has a being in the Soul, it is granted that ſuch an <hi>all abſolute fulneſs of Love</hi> was <hi>actually</hi> ſtill in the Soul of Chriſt, becauſe this is no other then the <hi>actual</hi> abode of the <hi>habitual fulneſs</hi> of holy <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But then this is nothing to the purpoſe, it having never been brought into Controverſie by the Doctor, but alwaies granted and allowed.</p>
               <p>§. 79. But if it be taken in the firſt ſenſe, as our <hi>Refuters</hi> words import, as it denotes the <hi>inward Acts of Chriſt's Love,</hi> moſt certain it is that there was not in him a <hi>perpetual All-ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> of his <hi>actual Love,</hi> ſo as the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> were either <hi>intenſively</hi> or <hi>extenſively</hi> ſtill <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate</hi> to his <hi>habitual Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 80. This is it which our <hi>Refuter</hi> aſſerts in oppoſition to Doctor <hi>Hammond.</hi> And now that he is moſt groſly miſtaken in it will appear, Firſt, if we ſhall conſider the <hi>Subjectum quod,</hi> as they call it, of this <hi>Habit</hi> and the <hi>Operations</hi> of holy <hi>Charity,</hi> the <hi>Subject</hi> wherein they are ſeated, <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For though the <hi>Habit</hi> of holy <hi>Charity</hi> was alwaies in him in its height and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:119243:140"/> from the firſt moment of Conception, as <hi>congruous</hi> to the <hi>hypoſtatical union,</hi> and flowing from it; yet there muſt be an <hi>intermiſſion</hi> and <hi>ceſſation</hi> in the <hi>Subject,</hi> at leaſt of ſome <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> of this Grace. For we read that <hi>Jeſus ſlept,</hi> and his <hi>humane nature</hi> did require it as a neceſſary ſupport of <note place="margin">Matth. 8. 24.</note> it. And therefore ſince ſome <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Vertues</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> can be onely performed by us when awake, there muſt be an <hi>intermiſſion</hi> and a <hi>ceſſation</hi> of them at leaſt when he <hi>ſlept,</hi> which cannot poſſibly be ſaid of the <hi>Habit</hi> of holy <hi>Charity,</hi> which was in him in full perfectneſs, whether <hi>ſleeping</hi> or <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 81. Secondly, if we ſhall conſider the <hi>Object</hi> of divine <hi>Charity,</hi> there was alwaies an <hi>habitual application</hi> or <hi>inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Bleſſed Saviour to all the <hi>Objects</hi> of divine <hi>Charity,</hi> and that according to that order and degree of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be found in them: but there could not be an <hi>actual</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the <hi>Will</hi> alwaies to all the ſeveral <hi>Objects</hi> of divine <hi>Charity,</hi> becauſe being <hi>finite</hi> in his humane nature, by that <hi>finite humane Will,</hi> howſoever perfected and advanced by the infuſed perfection of <hi>habitual</hi> grace, he could not poſſibly apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to an <hi>actual embrace</hi> of ſo many and different <hi>Objects,</hi> at one and the ſame <hi>moment</hi> and inſtant of time.</p>
               <p>§. 82. Thirdly, if we ſhall conſider the ſeveral <hi>Acts</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they were ſo many and infinite for <hi>number,</hi> ſo different for <hi>variety,</hi> we ſhall find it impoſſible that they ſhould be all performed at once, though there was alwaies and in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of time an <hi>habitual diſpoſition</hi> and <hi>aptitude</hi> to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of any or of all of them <hi>ſucceſſively,</hi> as himſelf ſhould beſt think fit.</p>
               <p>§. 83. If it be here replyed, that though the <hi>actual Love</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> could not be in him in its utmoſt extent and latitude, though he could not perform all the <hi>Acts</hi> of divine <hi>Charity</hi> at one and the ſame moment, to which he had alwaies an <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual inclination;</hi> yet this nothing hinders but that whenſoever he did perform any <hi>Act</hi> of holy <hi>Charity,</hi> that <hi>Act</hi> of holy <hi>Charity</hi> muſt be as intenſively perfect as the <hi>Habit</hi> from whence
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:119243:140"/> it iſſues, and this was all that you intended in this Objection.</p>
               <p>§. 84. To this I anſwer, That as we have already demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>falſhood</hi> of this Aſſertion, ſo were it now granted, yet this would not ſerve the turn at preſent. For ſince by this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it is granted that all the <hi>Acts</hi> of this <hi>Habit</hi> in their utmoſt latitude and extent cannot be performed at once, it neceſſarily follows, that thoſe <hi>Acts</hi> that may <hi>pro tempore</hi> be ſuſpended, and not have a <hi>being,</hi> without a derogation from the all-fulneſs of his <hi>habitual Love,</hi> may alſo have a being leſs intenſively perfect then the <hi>Habit</hi> or then other <hi>Acts</hi> of the ſame Love, without any derogation from the perpetual fulneſs of this <hi>habitual Grace.</hi> For plain it is that theſe <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> of divine <hi>Grace</hi> and holy <hi>Charity</hi> are not all <hi>in individuo</hi> the <hi>neceſſary</hi> iſſues of the <hi>Habit,</hi> as thoſe <hi>Properties</hi> and <hi>Accidents</hi> are that flow from their Cauſes by way of <hi>emanation,</hi> and <hi>neceſſity of nature,</hi> as the <hi>light</hi> from the <hi>Sun;</hi> but are the <hi>free effects</hi> of the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Habit</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> from whence they flow, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are <hi>extrinſecal</hi> and <hi>contingent</hi> to the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>being</hi> and <hi>gradual Perfection</hi> of the <hi>Habit.</hi> For ſince, as <hi>Porphyry</hi> tells us, <hi>Accidens commune eſt, quod poteſt adeſſe &amp; abeſſe ſine ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti interitu,</hi> if any one <hi>Act</hi> may be <hi>totally</hi> and in reſpect of <hi>all Degrees</hi> abſent, and not have a being, without derogation from the Perfection of the <hi>Habit,</hi> the ſame may in 2, or 3, or 5 De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Perfection be alſo abſent; ſince if the <hi>whole</hi> be acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental to the <hi>Habit,</hi> much more muſt every <hi>part</hi> and <hi>degree</hi> be accidental to it alſo.</p>
               <p>§. 85. And therefore I ſee not what diſadvantage can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crew to the Doctor, if this your Aſſertion be granted as you have laid it down <hi>in Terminis.</hi> For we have already demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, that ſome <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Chriſts Love</hi> were not ſo gradually intenſe as others were: we have alſo ſeen it proved by <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and the Authority of <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jeanes</hi> and his own <hi>Ames</hi> among the reſt, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>really increaſe,</hi> and not only in the <hi>opinion</hi> of men, as well in <hi>actual Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> as he did in <hi>Stature,</hi> though the <hi>Habit</hi> was alwaies at the height and perfection. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:119243:141"/> I ſee not how a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real</hi> increaſe in the gradual Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>inward Operations</hi> of <hi>Wiſdome</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> can any more derogate from the all-ful perfection of the <hi>Habit</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> then a true and real increaſe and growth in his <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> could any waies derogate from the truth and full perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his <hi>humane nature</hi> or <hi>Manhood.</hi> For though <hi>a greater intenſion preſuppoſeth remiſſion and imperfection,</hi> and though <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſio eſt eductio rei intenſae de imperfecto ad perfectum,</hi> as <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> often; yet if the <hi>Habit</hi> be <hi>full</hi> and <hi>perfect,</hi> and incapable of any diminution or increaſe, the gradual increaſe and perfection in the <hi>Acts</hi> will no more conclude the <hi>real growth</hi> and <hi>encreaſe</hi> of the <hi>Habit,</hi> then our Saviours growth in his <hi>Stature</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a growth in the perfection of his <hi>Manhood.</hi> As his <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature</hi> was compleat and perfect in his <hi>Infancy,</hi> though his <hi>Stature</hi> were now in growth; ſo the <hi>Habits</hi> of <hi>Wiſedome</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> were then alſo perfect, though his <hi>actual Wiſedome</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> were now capable of addition and growth, as his <hi>Stature</hi> was.</p>
               <p>§. 86. And therefore for a <hi>period</hi> of this Section, and the full acquitting the Doctor from the leaſt <hi>ſuſpition</hi> of this Charge, I muſt again mind our <hi>Refuter</hi> of that known diſtinction in <hi>Scheibler</hi> which he borrowed from <hi>Scaliger.</hi> And it is this; That as <hi>Habits</hi> are either <hi>infuſed</hi> or <hi>acquiſite,</hi> ſo the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> belonging to them are either <hi>praecedaneous</hi> to the <hi>Habit,</hi> and <hi>effectually</hi> concurre to the production and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of it, or elſe they are ſuch as are <hi>ſubſequent,</hi> and flow from it now compleat and perfect, as <hi>Effects</hi> from their <hi>Cauſe.</hi> Though then an intenſive perfection and growth in thoſe <hi>Acts</hi> and Operations that praecede, and effectively concur to the production of the <hi>Habit,</hi> argue alſo an intenſive growth in the perfection of the <hi>Habit</hi> to be <hi>acquired,</hi> and <hi>Aquinas</hi> his Rule does hold true in them: yet the <hi>Habit</hi> of holy <hi>Charity</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> being not an <hi>acquired</hi> but an <hi>infuſed Habit,</hi> and alwaies from the firſt moment perfect in its utmoſt intenſion, the <hi>Rule</hi> holds not, but an intenſive growth and gradual difference in the <hi>Acts</hi> here argues only an innocent liberty of the <hi>Will,</hi> whoſe <hi>free effects</hi> they are, and no intenſive growth in the <hi>Habit</hi> at all. For that being already full and perfect, and ſeated in the <hi>Will,</hi> and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:119243:141"/> effectively concurring with it to the production of theſe <hi>Acts</hi> &amp; <hi>Operations,</hi> it may, if it be not otherwiſe <hi>ab extrinſeco</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, either <hi>inſtantaneouſly</hi> produce the <hi>Acts</hi> in this or that degree <hi>perfect,</hi> or elſe may <hi>ſucceſſively</hi> augment them in gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al perfection. I ſhall give you a reaſon in part borrowed from <hi>Aquinas.</hi> For the gradual Perfection of theſe <hi>ſubſequent Acts</hi> depends not ſo much upon the <hi>Perfection</hi> of the <hi>Object,</hi> as the <hi>liberty</hi> of the <hi>Will,</hi> and the gradual difference in the <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> and <hi>Conatus</hi> of the <hi>Agent, praecipuè</hi> (as he ſaies <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>The Doctors diſcourſe here only</hi> ad hominem. <hi>The Refuters Reply grants all that the Doctors Argument aimes at.

The Doctor ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues from the Effect to the Cauſe. The reaſonableneſs of the proof.

                     <hi>The pertinency of the Doctors Argument, and impertinence of the Refuters Charge. The Doctors Argument</hi> à Poſteriori <hi>from the neceſſary relation between the work and the reward. Not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the Refuter. The outward work more valuable in Gods ſight, for the inward Fervour and Devotion. The Refuters</hi> Petitio principii. <hi>Works in a</hi> Phyſical <hi>ſenſe what, and what in a</hi> Moral. <hi>The Refuters diſcourſe of the infinite value of Chriſts merit ariſing from the dignity of his perſon. Nothing to the purpoſe. The dignity of a moral Action, according to the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Entity of the Act, or according to the dignity of the Perſon performing it. The Actions of Chriſt in regard of his Perſon infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in value. Not ſo in regard of their ſubſtantial Moral good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Proved: and acknowledged by our Refuter's own</hi> Suarez. <hi>Conſequently in this regard they might exceed one another in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Perfection. The Doctors Argument that it was ſo in Chriſt. The appoſiteneſs of the Proof. The Scriptures ſay the ſame.</hi>

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:119243:150"/> ſo alſo is the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>ſincerity</hi> more ſtrongly encreaſed, God, for the <hi>inward</hi> Fervours ſake, does reward men <hi>ſecundum opera,</hi> according to the multiplied <hi>Acts</hi> or <hi>outward works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 3. Well then, if the very multiplication of more <hi>outward Acts</hi> and <hi>works</hi> (for ſuch only the Doctor means) of any <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> be more valuable in the ſight of God (as without doubt they are) <hi>who rewards every man according to his works,</hi> and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the more <hi>abundant labour</hi> in the <hi>outward Act</hi> proceeds from the greater fervour and intenſeneſs of the <hi>inward Act,</hi> which alone gives life to it, it will evidently follow, that the <hi>length</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> (the <hi>outward Oraizon</hi> he meanes) in <hi>Chriſt</hi> is more <hi>valuable</hi> in the ſight of God (as the work is <hi>in it ſelf</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and without relation to the <hi>Perſon</hi> that does it; for of the work <hi>in it's own nature</hi> conſidered the Doctor ſpeaks, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the whole current of his diſcourſe) and that muſt needs argue it more excellent (in regard of the intenſive Perfection of the <hi>inward Act,</hi> which is that alone which God values) then the <hi>ſmaller number</hi> of thoſe <hi>Acts</hi> would be. And this as it clearly proves the Doctors <hi>Aſſertion,</hi> ſo it was the whole he aimed at in this argument.</p>

But it is no wonder that you argue ſo abſurdly, when you <hi>underſtand</hi> not the Diſcourſe you undertake to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute.

                           <p>A <hi>Great part of the</hi> Schoolmen <hi>will tell you, that the moral vertue of one ſingle Act of any vertue in Chriſt was infinite, and in the multiplication of more Acts there is but an infinite value: now one infinite cannot be greater then another infinite in the ſame kind wherein it is infinite; and hereupon they conclude that the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Acts makes nothing in Chriſt unto an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive addition of value. The value of one Act is intenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as great as that of more Acts.

               <p>§. 12. And therefore the actions of the humane Nature, though performed by a Divine perſon, being in their own <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical</hi> entity <hi>finite,</hi> and conſequently ſo alſo in reſpect of that <hi>moral goodneſs</hi> that is <hi>intrinſecally</hi> inhaerent in them, nothing hinders but that one in this reſpect may be better and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſely perfect then another, as well as one grief and torment which he ſuffered was greater then another.

               <p>§. 13. Well then, it being ſo clear and evident in it ſelf, and ſo acknowledged by our Refuters own <hi>Suarez,</hi> (for <hi>Albertinus</hi> I have not by me) that though every Act of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Perſon</hi> that performed it was of <hi>infinite,</hi> and ſo of an <hi>equal</hi>

                  <hi>intenſive</hi> value, yet in reſpect of the <hi>real entity</hi> and <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the Act and the <hi>Moral goodneſs inhering</hi> in it it was <hi>ſinite,</hi> as the <hi>Humane</hi> nature it ſelf wherein it was performed, nothing hinders but they, being <hi>finite,</hi> might exceed one another in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual perfection and intenſeneſs, &amp; in that moral goodneſs that was intrinſecally inherent in them.</p>
               <p>§. 14. Seeing then that nothing <hi>ab intrinſeco</hi> hinders but that this might be ſo, the Doctor now, like a <hi>rational</hi> man and a <hi>Scholar,</hi> here brings his <hi>Medium</hi> to prove that <hi>de facto</hi> it <hi>was</hi> ſo.</p>
               <p>§. 15. And as the ſubject matter of the preſent diſcourſe was only the <hi>moral goodneſs</hi> and different gradual perfection <hi>in the Acts</hi> of this <hi>habitual Grace,</hi> ſo he makes uſe of ſuch <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um's</hi> that properly concern that Subject. The <hi>Moral</hi> value a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from the <hi>Dignity</hi> of the <hi>Perſon</hi> that performed it, would make nothing to the purpoſe. And therefore, though he knew it as well as our Refuter, yet being loth, contrary to the lawes of Art and Method, <hi>tranſire à Genere ad Genus,</hi> he would take no notice of it, but keep cloſe to the preſent argument.</p>
               <p>§. 16. And prov'd his aſſertion he has by a very clear and appoſite <hi>medium,</hi> his <hi>Argument</hi> rightly proceeding from the <hi>Reward</hi> to the <hi>Work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For though all the <hi>Actions</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as weighed in the ſcale of <hi>Merit,</hi> at the great <hi>Tribunal</hi> were <hi>valued (actually valued</hi> I ſay) according to the <hi>dignity</hi> of the <hi>Perſon,</hi> and not the <hi>finite</hi> goodneſs <hi>really inherent in the Acts;</hi> yet nothing hinders but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the gradual perfection <hi>in the Acts</hi> themſelves, &amp; their mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied numbers and works, as they may and were by God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered <hi>in themſelves,</hi> ſo, <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For moſt plain it is, that the Scriptures tell us
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:119243:154"/> 
                  <hi>that God rewards every man according to his work.</hi> And therefore if God <hi>de facto</hi> thus proceed in the rewarding of the Acts of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, the Acts &amp; operations of the vertues of Chriſt, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered according to their own <hi>real</hi> and <hi>intrinſick</hi> goodneſs, might be <hi>valuable</hi> alſo in his ſight. For why that <hi>Moral</hi> good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>intrinſecally</hi> inherent in the Act, and <hi>à qua,</hi> as <hi>Suarez</hi> tells us, <hi>Actus dicitur bonus moraliter &amp; actus virtutis,</hi> ſhould not in the Actions of Chriſt be <hi>valuable</hi> in Gods ſight, I ſee no reaſon, ſince it is ſo in reſpect of all other men beſides. And this was that which the Doctor alone aimed at. For this is all that he ſaies, <hi>The very multiplication of more Acts of any vertue, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it equally ſincere in the Habit (and ſuch is the length of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er when it is in Chriſt) is more valuable in the ſight of God, &amp; that argues it more excellent then the ſmaller number of thoſe Acts would be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 17. And if I be not very much deceived, the Scripture ſpeaks very agreeably to this purpoſe. For it tells us expreſly that, <note n="|" place="margin">Rom. 5. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>God commendeth his love toward us, in that whilſt we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us.</hi> And is it not the <hi>commendation</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's Love,</hi> that he <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note>

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:119243:165"/> might with convenience, and without any derogation from the Perfection of his <hi>divine nature,</hi> or the heaven happineſſe of his Soul (which he enjoyed as <hi>Comprehenſor)</hi> not only <hi>pray</hi> to God for his aſſiſtance, but <hi>bleſſe</hi> and magnifie him for it. As <hi>Comprehenſor</hi> indeed, and one already fully poſſeſſed of heaven happineſſe and the ſight of God, there was no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he ſhould <hi>pray,</hi> ſince in this he could not <hi>want,</hi> but was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready perfectly poſſeſſed of whatſoever he was capable of: But then as he was yet in ſome reſpects truly in the ſtate of a <hi>Viator,</hi> one ſubject to miſeries and infirmities and bodily wants, and not yet poſſeſſed of that glory and thoſe <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note>

               <p>§. 26. But what though <hi>Chriſt</hi> as <hi>man</hi> were in capacity to petition at the <hi>Throne of grace</hi> for thoſe things which as <hi>man</hi> he might need, and was not able to perform, will it therefore follow that as <hi>man,</hi> being alſo God, it was <hi>fit</hi> for him to pray? For <hi>all things are lawful for me,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>yet all things are not expedient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 27. To this I anſwer, that whether we conſider his tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent love to God, or his particular neceſſities in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, or his Charity and Love to man, for whoſe ſake he became man, there could nothing be more <hi>decent,</hi> or that could better become him. For firſt, if we ſhall conſider his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate and condition, as now he was in the <hi>form of a ſervant,</hi> obliged he was in <hi>duty</hi> to give God that <hi>Religious homage</hi> and <hi>Reverence</hi> which the Creature could pay to his Creator, ſuch worſhip and veneration that was due to the moſt high God <hi>that heareth prayer, unto whom all fleſh ſhall come, Pſalm.</hi> 65. 2.</p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:119243:165"/>
               <p> Secondly, If we conſider his tranſcendent and ſuperlative <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>God his Father,</hi> that would ſtill prompt him on by this <hi>beſt</hi> and <hi>nobleſt Act</hi> of worſhip to magnifie him; ſince it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but we ſhould endeavour, as much as in us lies, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of their honour whom we truly love and affect.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If we ſhall conſider the <hi>natural</hi> law of <hi>Charity,</hi> that obliges us to endeavour by all lawful waies the relief of our wants, the eaſe of our miſeries and the advancement of our happineſs, that would alſo engage him to <hi>Prayer,</hi> that is the beſt means to procure them at his hands that is the <hi>Father of lights, from whom every good and perfect gift proceeds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, If we ſhall conſider the <hi>Religious Piety</hi> and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent goodneſs in the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> it ſelf, that gives to God the <hi>honour due unto his name,</hi> that magnifies him in his beſt and nobleſt attributes of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Faithfulneſs,</hi> that owns him as the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>fountain</hi> of all good, the <hi>father of Mercies and the God of all conſolation;</hi> there could be no Act more becoming him that was ſo every way <hi>holy,</hi> and ſo <hi>abundant</hi> and <hi>fruitful</hi> in every <hi>good work.</hi> And therefore ſaies God in the Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 15. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, If we ſhall conſider the great <hi>end</hi> of his coming into the world, which was to <hi>work out our Salvation,</hi> we ſhall find it fit and expedient he ſhould accompliſh it by all waies whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; not only by ſatisfying Gods <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>meriting</hi> our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but alſo by his <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Interceſſion,</hi> and leaving us an <hi>example</hi> in all the <hi>nobleſt Acts</hi> of <hi>Vertue,</hi> and inſtructing us in the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>means</hi> how we ſhould behave our ſelves in this part of divine worſhip, and alſo how we might procure a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of our wants from him who alone is able to relieve and help us.</p>
               <p>§. 28. And therefore no wonder, ſince it was every way ſo <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>expedient</hi> for <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>pray,</hi> that God himſelf did alſo <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree</hi> and <hi>ordain</hi> that he ſhould uſe it, not only for our <hi>example.</hi> and an <hi>exerciſe</hi> of <hi>vertue,</hi> but alſo as a <hi>neceſſary means</hi> for a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement of thoſe bleſſings which it was fit he ſhould deſire.</p>

               <p> §. 33. And hitherto all is clear and plain. But now we are fallen upon a difficulty indeed. For it is not eaſily underſtood how Chriſt ſhould ſo earneſtly pray for a removal of that Cup which he came on purpoſe to drink off. For had he a promiſe to be heard in this particular alſo? If he had, ſince <hi>God is faithfull in his promiſes,</hi> why was it not then performed?

                     <p>Between theſe deſires and reſolutions there was a diverſity, but no contrariety; a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination, but no repugnance or reſiſtance. There was no contrariety, becauſe they were not in reſpect of the ſame circumſtances; for Death as Death is to be avoided: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did ſuperiour Reaſon ever diſlike the judgement of the inferiour Faculties, but ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed further and higher conſiderations, where it was to be accepted and embraced. There was no repugnance or reſiſtance, becauſe one yielded to the other. For as—the ſick man conſidering the Portion—to be bitter—declineth it while he ſtayes within—that Conſideration; but when he caſts his eyes further—on the happy operation,—he willingly accepts it—So Chriſt conſidering Death as in it ſelf evill, and contrary to nature, while he ſtay'd within the bounds and confines of that conſideration, ſhunned and declined it; and yet as the means of mans Salvation joyfully embraced it, accepting that he refuſed, and refuſing that he accepted. <hi>Field of the Church,</hi> l. 5. c. 18. p. 452.

               <p>§. 75. And therefore, though it is evident that now it will be loſt labour to make any <hi>reflections</hi> upon the <hi>former part</hi> of our <hi>Refuters</hi> ſecond Anſwer, yet to gratifie him in theſe his <hi>injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> I ſhall caſt ſome light <hi>ſtrictures</hi> on it, though the Doctor did not, becauſe it was <hi>needleſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 76. Whereas then our <hi>Refuter</hi> ſaies in the application of the firſt branch of his ſecond anſwer, <hi>That if we conſider Chriſts prayer in reference unto the Object unto whom it was made, God, the religion and inward worſhip of his Prayer was for degrees al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies alike equal. His truſt and dependance upon God, love of zeal, and devotion towards God, from which all his Prayers flowed, were not at one time more intenſe then at another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 77. To this I anſwer Firſt,</p>
               <p>1. That if theſe be conſidered in the <hi>Habit,</hi> without doubt they were alwaies alike <hi>equal,</hi> they were not at one time more intenſe then at another; becauſe <hi>habitually</hi> they were alwaies in him in the full height and <hi>Perfection.</hi> But then this is not the queſtion between him and the Doctor. 2. But then ſecondly, if theſe be conſidered in their ſeveral <hi>Acts,</hi> and if we ſhall <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare</hi> them one with another, there muſt of neceſſity be a gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al difference in them according to the preſent <hi>exigence</hi> and <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</hi> The reaſon is one and the ſame in theſe and all other <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>vertue, quod ſcilicet,</hi> as <hi>Cajetan</hi> truly, <hi>ſi homo exercet</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cajetan. <hi>in</hi> 2. 2. <hi>q.</hi> 38. <hi>art.</hi> 12. <hi>in reſponſ. ad terlium.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>eos tenetur eos exercere cum debitis circumſtantiis,</hi> A man is bound to perform them with all due and lawful circumſtances. And therefore though the <hi>Habit</hi> of divine <hi>Charity,</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Devotion,</hi> &amp;c. be alwaies full, yet the <hi>will of Chriſt</hi> did perform the ſeveral <hi>Acts</hi> of thoſe <hi>graces</hi> according to thoſe <hi>due mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi> and <hi>circumſtances</hi> that <hi>Gods Law</hi> required. His love to God in the <hi>Act,</hi> I mean in that <hi>high,</hi> that <hi>tranſcendent Act</hi> of
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:119243:181"/> divine <hi>Love</hi> immediately terminated on <hi>God,</hi> was at the height; his own <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>exaltation</hi> in the Humane Nature he loved in a proportionable degree next to that, and then the <hi>Church,</hi> and then his own <hi>life,</hi> which yet he laid down for the <hi>redemption</hi> of the Faithful. So alſo in the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> and Devotion, they were alwaies performed with that fervency as the preſent <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> and the things that he prayed for did <hi>require.</hi> This alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy has abundantly been demonſtrated, and therefore needs no further proof.</p>
               <p>§. 78. Secondly I anſwer, That if we ſhall conſider Chriſts <hi>actuall Love</hi> as immediatly terminated on God, and the <hi>Acts</hi> of his <hi>truſt</hi> and <hi>dependance</hi> upon him, his <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> and Devotion towards him, that immediatly flowed from his all-full and perfect <hi>knowledge</hi> of Gods abſolute ſoveraignty and goodneſs, which as <hi>Comprehenſor,</hi> and alſo by the Habit of infuſed knowledge of God he enjoyed, thoſe were alwaies one and the ſame; he could not <hi>love</hi> him <hi>more</hi> then he did, or <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> him <hi>more</hi> then he did, or <hi>truſt</hi> in him <hi>more</hi> then he did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was impoſſible he ſhould <hi>know</hi> or <hi>enjoy</hi> him <hi>more</hi> then he did. But theſe being the <hi>ſpring</hi> and <hi>fountain</hi> from which all Chriſts <hi>Prayers</hi> flowed, as our <hi>Refuter</hi> expreſly acknowledges, were not the <hi>Acts</hi> of that holy <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi> that are now in controverſie between himſelf and the Doctor; and therefore their <hi>conſtant fulneſs</hi> of <hi>intenſive perfection</hi> makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>§. 79. But then there are other <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> of <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi> which flow from theſe as the <hi>effects</hi> from their <hi>cauſe,</hi> and of which only the Doctor ſpake, as we have abundantly demonſtrated, that differed one from another in <hi>gradual Perfection.</hi> We have already proved it of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Prayer in the Garden.</p>

The <hi>Acts</hi> then of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Truſt</hi> and <hi>dependance</hi> upon <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi> to him, may be conſidered either <hi>preciſely</hi> and <hi>abſtractly</hi> in themſelves, and by themſelves, as flowing from peculiar <hi>Habits</hi> and <hi>Vertues</hi> of the ſame names,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:119243:182"/> which are the <hi>cauſes</hi> and <hi>fountains</hi> from whence all our <hi>Prayers</hi> flow: (for <hi>pray</hi> we do to God, becauſe we <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>reverence,</hi> and <hi>truſt</hi> and <hi>depend</hi> on him) or elſe as they are the <hi>Acts</hi> iſſuing <hi>from Prayer,</hi> as they are the <hi>conſequents</hi> and <hi>

And therefore, as <hi>Cajetan</hi> well obſerves, there <note place="margin">Cajetan. <hi>in</hi> 2. 2. Thom <hi>q.</hi> 83. <hi>art.</hi> 3.</note> are three things conſiderable in <hi>Prayer;</hi> Firſt, the thing prayed for, the <hi>object</hi> of our deſires and prayers: and in this we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Gods <hi>fulneſs</hi> and ſuperlative <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> becauſe we deſire to have our <hi>wants</hi> ſupplied from his <hi>ſtore,</hi> and therefore we ask it of him. Secondly, the <hi>Petition</hi> it ſelf: and thus we <hi>honour</hi> God alſo, becauſe our very <hi>Petition</hi> and <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> is an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>ſubjection,</hi> and an <hi>acknowledgement</hi> of Gods <hi>power</hi> to help us; for he that <hi>asks</hi> any thing of another, does <hi>eo ipſo</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his own <hi>wants,</hi> and by this very <hi>Act</hi> does <hi>ſubmit</hi> himſelf to his <hi>will</hi> and <hi>power;</hi> he does alſo in this his asking pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs a <hi>Power</hi> in him to whom he prayes to <hi>relieve</hi> him, a <hi>goodneſs</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> that will <hi>encline</hi> him to make uſe of this his <hi>Power</hi> to his relief, and a <hi>wiſedome</hi> and gracious <hi>Providence</hi> to over rule and order all things, that they may beſt ſerve for his <hi>relief.</hi> Thirdly, the <hi>Petitioner,</hi> who by his <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>underſtanding</hi> does petition God, (for <hi>Prayer</hi> is an <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> the <hi>prime</hi> and moſt noble part of man:) and thus he alſo <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> God in this, in that he ſubjects the <hi>nobleſt part</hi> of his <hi>Soul</hi> to him, makes uſe of <hi>that</hi> to expreſs his <hi>deſires,</hi> and <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement</hi> of his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 81. And now as by all theſe we <hi>honour</hi> God in <hi>Prayer,</hi> ſo our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>worſhip</hi> in the firſt and ſecond <hi>reſpects</hi> are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>augmentation,</hi> and God may be <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs</hi> honoured by
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:119243:182"/> them. Nay in the third alſo this is poſſible of increaſe, when the <hi>Petitioner,</hi> as we ſay in our <hi>Liturgie,</hi> does offer up not only his <hi>mind,</hi> but his <hi>whole ſoul</hi> and <hi>body,</hi> and every <hi>part</hi> and <hi>faculty</hi> of it in <hi>Prayer,</hi> the <hi>Mind</hi> to <hi>conceive,</hi> the <hi>Will</hi> to <hi>cenſent,</hi> the <hi>Tongue,</hi> the <hi>Hand,</hi> the <hi>Eye,</hi> the <hi>Knee,</hi> all to teſtifie and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our <hi>homage.</hi> But in the firſt and ſecond there can be no doubt. When we petition God for <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>heavenly</hi> bleſſings, we more <hi>honour</hi> him in this <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> then when we ask him only <hi>temporal,</hi> becauſe we hereby more acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his tranſcendent <hi>Perfection, Grace</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs.

So alſo when with greater <hi>longings</hi> of ſpirit, ſtronger <hi>ardencies</hi> and <hi>deſires</hi> we petition him, hereby we acknowledge our greater <hi>truſt</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> in his <hi>Power</hi> to help us, which more magnifies and honours him. We ſhould not come with <hi>ſo much eagerneſs,</hi> unleſs we had the <hi>greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence</hi> in his <hi>Wiſdome, Power</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 82. And thus Prayer being an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> as <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> truly, which in the <hi>Act of Prayer</hi> is capable of increaſe, this may and ordinarily is gradually intended, though the former were not. And yet we have already ſeen, that our Saviour did as well increaſe in the <hi>Perfection</hi> of the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Wiſdome</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> as he did in <hi>Stature,</hi> and this acknowledged by our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>§. 83. In ſhort then, the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Devotion,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Truſt</hi> in Chriſt <hi>praying</hi> (or theſe Acts from whence his <hi>Prayers</hi> did all <hi>iſſue,</hi> as our <hi>Refuter</hi> has it) might be ſtill gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually the <hi>ſame,</hi> and yet the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip</hi> of and in his <hi>Prayer</hi> might be, and often was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion, augmented, particularly in his prayer in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. And this was all that Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> intended.

               <p> §. 5. But before I come to conſider his arguments, it will be needful again to mind the Reader of the <hi>ambiguity</hi> of the Phraſe, <hi>The Love of God. Charitas Dei, ſive in Deum,</hi> ſaies <hi>Crellius</hi> (in this no <hi>Socinian) quae per ſe tota ad Deum ſpectat, non uno modo in Sacris literis accipitur.

               <p>The Conſequence of this, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>§. 1. Well, Sir, hold you there. Are the Inward Acts of thoſe Vertues and Graces, and particularly the Inward Acts of the habitual Grace of divine Charity, that very <hi>actual love of God that was in Termino, as they ſay, alwaies at the higheſt?</hi> were they the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as he was <hi>perfectus Comprehenſor,</hi> as you intimate in your ſecond Argument? I deſire your Reaſon for it, and do not <hi>dictate,</hi> but <hi>prove</hi> it. I had thought that theſe had, if not all, yet the greateſt part of them agreed to Chriſt only as
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:119243:186"/> 
                  <hi>Viator,</hi> according to the frail, mortal condition of his ſtate of humiliation. What need, I pray, had he of <hi>Truſt</hi> and <hi>depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi> on God for a ſupply of any want, that now, as <hi>Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſor,</hi> was fully poſſeſſed of heaven happineſs? what need had he to pray or hope, <hi>the</hi> heaven <hi>happineſs</hi> of <hi>whoſe ſoul did now even during the whole time of his abode</hi> here on earth <hi>far ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount that of all the Saints and Angels in heaven,</hi> as you aſſert in your ſecond argument? Have the Saints and Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven any need of Patience, and Meekneſs, and Fortitude, and Temperance, and Obedience, and an humble ſubmiſſion to the Croſs? does not the Apoſtle tell us, that high and moſt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent <hi>Act</hi> of Divine <hi>Charity</hi> ſhall <hi>remain</hi> where God is all in all? do not the Schoolmen that write <hi>de merito Chriſti</hi> ſay, that Chriſt did not merit, but only as he was <hi>Viator?</hi> Why then do you ſo ignorantly or negligently confound thoſe Acts and Graces that are <hi>incompoſſible,</hi> as they ſpeak? As <hi>Comprehenſor</hi> he could not merit, and as <hi>Viator</hi> he was not in poſſeſſion of heaven happineſs. As <hi>Comprehenſor</hi> his holy Love was alwaies in <hi>Termino,</hi> and a neceſſary effect of the Beatifical viſion: As <hi>Viator</hi> it was not a neceſſary, but a free Act of his will, and the effect of the <hi>habit</hi> of divine <hi>Grace.</hi> As <hi>Comprehenſor</hi> he has no need of the <hi>Habits</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> of Vertues, but only as <hi>Viator,</hi> in which ſtate he was only in a Capacity to exerciſe them. Either therefore, Sir, write more diſtinctly and to the purpoſe, or elſe forbear troubling the world for the future with your <hi>Scholaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> notions, which are ſo crude and half codled.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Howſoever I obſerve that in your firſt Argument you rightly underſtand the Doctors <hi>Notion</hi> of <hi>The Love of God,</hi> and take it here, as he ſtill does, in the <hi>large</hi> ſenſe, as it is all one with holy <hi>Charity,</hi> as containing in its <hi>general</hi> notion the <hi>Acts</hi> of all <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Vertues</hi> whatſoever: And therefore becauſe now <hi>habemus confitentem r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>um,</hi> I am reſolved to hold you to your Conceſſion; and ſo I come to examine it. In ſhort it is this,</p>
               <p>§. 3. If the habitual Grace and Habits of all Graces and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues were in Chriſt alwaies full and perfect, then ſo were the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:119243:186"/> inward Acts of thoſe Vertues and Graces, and particularly the inward Acts of Charity. But the Antecedent is true; <hi>Ergo,</hi> alſo the Conſequent.</p>
               <p>§. 4. To this, Sir, I anſwer by denying the ſequele of your Major. My Reaſon is, Becauſe all <hi>Habits</hi> whatſoever, whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther <hi>infuſed</hi> or <hi>acquiſite,</hi> that are ſeated in the <hi>Will,</hi> are <hi>free,</hi> and not <hi>neceſſary</hi> cauſes of the <hi>Acts</hi> that iſſue from them. And therefore though all <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>neceſſary cauſes</hi> do work uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly and equally, and produce the ſame effects, where the diſtance is the ſame, and the Patient equally diſpoſed; yet in <hi>voluntary</hi> free cauſes it is far otherwiſe, as we have ſhewed. And therefore ſince the inward or <hi>immanent Acts</hi> of all <hi>Habits</hi> are <hi>elicite Acts</hi> of the <hi>Will,</hi> and not <hi>neceſſary</hi> effects, their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual <hi>intenſion</hi> and <hi>remiſſion</hi> in this ſenſe depends not upon the <hi>Phyſical efficaciouſneſs,</hi> but the <hi>free</hi> and <hi>voluntary</hi> exerciſe of that intrinſick virtue, as we have already demonſtrated.</p>
               <p>§. 5. But he goes on and tells us that.</p>

Did you not juſt now tell us, that you would not <hi>barely dictate,</hi> but <hi>prove</hi> what you undertook? And have you not told the world ſo long ſince in your very Title-page? And muſt we now be put off to look for a <hi>Proof</hi> I know not where? I think I have given the world abundant ſatisfaction already, that you have very little reaſon to refer us to your former Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances. They ſay of the Chickens that are hatched in the furnaces of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that they all come from the egg lame and
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:119243:187"/> imperfect, for want of a natural kindly warmth. And ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortive cripled lame creatures are all your proofes, for want of a truly genuine and Scholaſtical heat in the brain that brings them forth. Though in outward modeſty, like <hi>Caeſar,</hi> you ſeem to decline the title and office of <hi>Perpetual Dictator;</hi> yet it concernes you in poynt of Intereſt, as it did that great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, not to forego it, that you may ſecure your great <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories</hi> over <hi>Truth</hi> and Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> But by your ſo worthy performances in this Part of your argument, you give me very little hope that you have better quitted your ſelf by the teſtimonies of the School men.</p>

               <p>§. 9. But Firſt, I pray, Sir, why cite you not <hi>Aquinas</hi> from his own writings? why do you quote him twice from <hi>Capreolus?</hi> For what if <hi>Capreolus</hi> has miſquoted <hi>Aquinas,</hi> or not rightly underſtood him? what if he onely made uſe of thoſe words that might beſt ſerve for his preſent purpoſe, and left out thoſe that might clear the preſent difficulty? or what if he quoted <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> only to refute him, as uſually the latter <hi>School-men</hi> do the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:119243:188"/> former? Now as theſe may be poſſible, ſo if either of them be certainly ſo, what then I beſeech you is become of your proof from <hi>Aquinas?</hi> You ſhould therefore, like a man that would write ſolidly, and as becomes a Maſter of Controverſies, have referred us to the place it ſelf in the Author, that ſo we might by the <hi>Antecedents</hi> and <hi>Conſequents</hi> rightly have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered whether you have not miſtaken the meaning of your Author.</p>
               <p>§. 10. But for the preſent we will ſuppoſe that theſe are the words of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> or that (which I rather beleeve, becauſe I find ſome things tending to it in that Author) <hi>Capreolus</hi> has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us the ful meaning of the place. And therefore I ſhall now conſider how they ſerve to our <hi>Refuters</hi> advantage.</p>
               <p>§. 11. The Sequel or Enthymeme to be confirmed by the Teſtimony of the School-men is this, That ſeeing the <hi>Habits</hi> of all Vertues, and in particular that of divine Grace and holy Charity in Chriſt, were all fully and moſt intenſively perfect in him, therefore the inward <hi>Acts</hi> of thoſe Vertues and Graces muſt be all as full and equally perfect in themſelves, and with the <hi>Habits.</hi> But do any of theſe Teſtimonies ſpeak to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe?

Similiter etiam ipſa eſſentialiter eſt virtus ordinata ad actum: unde idem eſt ipſam augeri ſecundum eſſentiam, &amp; ipſam habere efficaciam ad producendum ferventioris dilectionis actum. Augetur ergo eſſentialiter, non quidem ita, quod eſſe incipiat, vel eſſe deſinat in ſubjecto ſicut objectio illa procedit; ſed ita, quod magis &amp; magis in ſubjecto eſſe incipiat.</hi> The paſſage that <hi>Capreolus</hi> alludes to in <hi>Aquinas</hi> is, as I ſuppoſe, partly taken out of this anſwer <hi>ad tertium,</hi> and partly from the body of the anſwer to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing queſtion, Art. 5. <hi>

               <p>§. 13. And now, Sir, will any man ſuppoſe that you ever conſulted the places that you quoted, ſince they make ſo little, ſo nothing to your purpoſe? For firſt, does not <hi>Aquinas</hi> here treat of the <hi>Habit</hi> of <hi>Charity,</hi> and not the <hi>Act?</hi> Does he not conſider it <hi>in abſtracto,</hi> and <hi>preciſely,</hi> as they ſpeak, according to the nature of the <hi>Form ſimply</hi> and in it ſelf conſidered, and not as it is in <hi>Concreto,</hi> in this or that ſubject planted? what it is naturally <hi>apt</hi> and diſpoſed to doe, not what it <hi>actually</hi> ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms? And ſecondly, does he not here all along, and in the other queſtions alſo, conſider Charity as it belongs to <hi>Sinners,</hi> and as it is capable of Increaſe, and not as it is in <hi>Chriſt</hi> in all fulneſs and perfection? How then can this any way ſerve your turn? You are gotten into a <hi>Quick-mire,</hi> and the more that you ſtrive, the more deeply you will plunge your ſelf.</p>

               <p> §. 14. In ſhort then I ſay, Though Neceſſary cauſes and Natural forms do always work <hi>uniformly,</hi> becauſe by a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Nature they work <hi>ad ultimum virium,</hi> to the utmoſt of their Power and Efficacy; yet in Voluntary Cauſes it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. They work not always according to their Power, but according to their Will and Pleaſure; and this becauſe they are naturally free and undetermined in their Operations. Of this kind are the Habits of Grace and Charity and all other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, whether in Chriſt or in all other men.</p>
               <p>§. 15. Your Argument then here is guilty of a double falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, For firſt you argue <hi>à Potentia ad Actum affirmativè,</hi> thus, The moſt perfect Charity, or that which is more gradually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, may or has a power and efficacy to produce the moſt or more noble Act, therefore of neceſſity it muſt, or always does ſo. Though this may be allowed in Natural and Neceſſary Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, yet how it fails in Voluntary Cauſes and Effects, there is no man can be ignorant.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you argue <hi>à dicto ſecundum quid ad dictum ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter,</hi> thus, Becauſe the Act can never be more noble or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe then the Habit, therefore of neceſſity it alwaies equals the Habit in gradual perfection. How theſe two fail I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſo often demonſtrated, that I am aſhamed to ſpeak to the ſame purpoſe ſo often; but our <hi>Refuter</hi> will have it ſo, and therefore we muſt obey him.</p>
               <p>§. 16. To your next place of <hi>Aquinas</hi> quoted by <hi>Capreolus</hi> (though here alſo I ſuppoſe that Author has given us the Meaning, not the words) let <hi>Aquinas</hi> himſelf anſwer, and let his words themſelves (to which I ſuppoſe <hi>Capreolus</hi> alludes) ſhew how it makes nothing to your purpoſe.

As for the habitual grace of Chriſt, which was all full and perfect, and belonged to him as <hi>Comprehenſor,</hi> that he treats of only (I mean <hi>ex profeſſo)</hi> in the third part of his <hi>Summes,</hi> and there you ſhould have ſought for proper <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums</hi> and not elſewhere.</p>
               <p>§. 19. If you ſhall here reply, that the Charity of Chriſt is <hi>Charitas Patriae</hi> and <hi>Charitas Comprehenſoris,</hi> and that <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> ſayes of that, <hi>quod totum cor hominis actualiter ſemper fera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in Deum,</hi> and therefore the Acts of his love muſt be always uniform and at the height:</p>
               <p>§. 20. To this I anſwer, The Charity of Chriſt, or Love that we now ſpeak of, is not <hi>actus Comprehenſoris</hi> (as ſhall inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſhewed,) but belonged to him as <hi>Viator,</hi> &amp; in its own gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Notion contained in it all Vertues and Graces whatſoever. The Acts of this Love, though they were always perfect in their kinds, yet of neceſſity they could not be equal in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in gradual perfection, becauſe of the gradual diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Objects of this Love, much leſs could they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual the all-full perfection of the Habit whence they iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued.</p>
               <p>§. 21. And thus we have ſeen that our <hi>Refuters</hi> two firſt te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies from <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and his laſt from <hi>Hurtado,</hi> make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>§. 22. As for his third from <hi>Aquinas,</hi> I muſt obſerve, that
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:119243:191"/> he has either groſſely prevaricated, or moſt ignorantly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his Author. For whereas <hi>Capreolus</hi> and <hi>Aquinas,</hi> in the place cited, ſpeak only of the perfection of Charity <hi>ex parte di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibilis,</hi> and in order to the <hi>Object beloved,</hi> he renders it to the Reader as if they had meant it of Charity <hi>ex parte diligentis,</hi> and in order to the <hi>perſon loving.</hi> The words in <hi>Capreolus</hi> as himſelf cites them are, <hi>Cum Actus &amp; Habitus ſpeciem habent ex Objecto, oportet quod ex eodem ratio perfection is ipſius ſuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Objectum autem Charitatis eſt ſummum bonum: igitur perfecta Charit as eſt, quae in ſummum bonum fertur in tantum in quantum eſt diligibile.</hi> 
                  <q>Which our <hi>Refuter</hi> thus renders, at leaſt to the ſenſe; <hi>The Habit of Love is then perfect when 'tis car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried towards God as the chief, when God is loved ſo far forth as he may be loved, to wit, by a creature: when God is not loved thus intenſely, the Habit of Love (as</hi> Aquinas <hi>thought) was imperfect.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>§. 23. In good time, Sir. But if it had been your good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be a <hi>Critick</hi> as well as Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and you had been ſo happy to know the difference between <hi>Participles</hi> end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>ens</hi> and ending in <hi>bilis,</hi> you would have otherwiſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>Capreolus,</hi> and not have made uſe of a Teſtimony that is ſo utterly a ſtranger to your Argument.</p>

               <p>§. 2. The place in <hi>Scotus</hi> at large is this: <hi>Contra, poſſibile eſt illam animam habere ſummam gratiam, ergo ſummam fruitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</hi>

Primo modo poſſibile eſt ſummam fruitionem creabilem conferri animae Chriſt, quia ipſa eſt receptiva cujuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet accidentis convenientis ſibi, &amp; in ſummo; quia non determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat ſibi certum gradum iſtius, ſicut fuit probatum in prima quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtione de gratia: et fruitio eſt quoddam accidens abſolutum, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibile creari à primo Cauſante immediate ſine actione voluntatis creatae. Secundo modo videtur probabile, quod cum illa voluntas non poſſit tantam vim activam habere quantam voluntas creata alia poteſt habere, ut Angelica, non poteſt it a perfectè elicere fruitionem ſicut alia voluntas poteſt. Licet enim poſſit ſummam gratiam habere, quae ut cauſa Partialis reſpectu fruitionis aequè cauſaret fruitionem in ipſa &amp; Angelo, ſi haberet eam; tamen alia cauſa partialis erit inaequalis, ut voluntas: altera autem cauſa partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis ſit aequalis; modo tamen de facto eſt maximè elicitiva, quia licet non ſit voluntas ejus ita perfecta ſicut voluntas Angeli, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ipſa cum ſumma gratia, ut aliâ causâ partiali activâ, poteſt ferri in perfectiorem fruitionem quam voluntas Angeli cum minori gratia, quia excedentia gratiae excedit in ea eſſicientiam volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis Angeli.</hi> The ſum in ſhort is this, that God <hi>de facto</hi> has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on Chriſt a fuller enjoyment of himſelf, becauſe of a larger meaſure of Grace, then he ha's upon Angels. For though the will of Angels be Naturally more perfect then the created Will of Chriſt, yet by Grace it is capable to receive
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:119243:192"/> whatſoever is fit for it, and God ſhall beſtow upon it.</p>
               <p>§. 25. And is not our Refuter a very unſucceſsful Man in all his Quotations? How can this in any meaſure concern the preſent debate? For does not here <hi>Scotus</hi> conſider firſt what was poſſible for God to do, or Chriſt to receive,? Does he not alſo here conſider him in the ſtate of <hi>Comprehenſor,</hi> and not of a <hi>Viator?</hi> Is not the queſtion moved concerning the poſſibility of Glory, upon the ſuppoſal of an Habitual fulneſs of Grace, and not at all of the Acts of Grace? Does he not prove by the very words that our <hi>Refuter</hi> has quoted, that ſince it was poſſible for Chriſt to have a fulneſs of Grace, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was alſo poſſible for him to have a fulneſs of heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs? and this becauſe Glory is the neceſſary effect of Grace, and Acts that neceſſarily flow, and by way of <hi>emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> from their Forms and Cauſes, muſt of neceſſity be equal in Perfection to the Forms from whence they iſſue? If then our <hi>Refuter</hi> will ſay any thing to the purpoſe, he muſt conclude that all the Inferiour Acts of Vertue and Grace in him did as Naturally flow from the <hi>Habits,</hi> as Glory does from Grace; and that Chriſt had no more proper Freedom to them, then he had, or has now to the Sight and enjoyment of God: which Poſition, as it expreſly deſtroyes the Foundation of his Merit, and the Redemption of the world by his death, ſo it is expreſly contrary to the Scriptures, and all the Fathers and Schoolmen and Orthodox Divines in the world, for ought I could ever learn.</p>

Fruitleſs here to enquire wherein the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Happineſs conſiſts according to the</hi> Thomiſts <hi>or</hi> Scotiſts. <hi>It follows not, becauſe Chriſts Love as</hi> Viator <hi>was more intenſe at one Time in ſome Acts, then at another in other Acts, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Happineſs as</hi> Comprehenſor <hi>was at that time diminiſhed.

                           <p>A <hi>Second argument is drawn from the perpetual and vn-interrupted happineſs of Chriſt. It is reſolved both by</hi> Aquinas 3. q. 34. art. 4. Scotus lib. 3. diſp. 18. <hi>and their followers, that Chriſt in regard of his ſoul was even here in this life, from the firſt moment of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, all his life long unto his death,</hi> perfectus Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſor; <hi>and therefore he injoyed in his Soul all that was neceſſary unto heaven happineſs.

And for the reſt of the</hi> Thomiſts, <hi>who hold that the eſſence of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſtands only in the</hi> Beatifical viſion <hi>of God, why even they make this actual moſt intenſe Love of God a natural and neceſſary conſequent of the</hi> Beatifick viſion.</p>

               <p>§. 1. To this I anſwer, That it is moſt true, as theſe <hi>Schoolmen</hi> determine, that Chriſt, by virtue of the <hi>hypoſtatical union</hi> was in the ſuperiour part of his ſoul, the mind, <hi>Perfectus Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſor</hi> from the firſt Moment of his Conception, and ſo he did love and enjoy God more perfectly then all the Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels did in heaven. This was a neceſſary Conſequent of the <hi>hypoſtatical union</hi> and the fulneſs of divine Grace. <hi>Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum eſt,</hi> ſaies <hi>Aquinas</hi> truly, <hi>Quod Chriſtus in primo inſtanti ſuae conceptionis accepit non ſolum tantam gratiam quantam</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Aquin. 3. <hi>p. q.</hi> 34. <hi>art.</hi> 4. <hi>in Corp.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Comprehenſores habent, ſed etiam omnibus comprehenſoribus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorem. Et quia gratia illa non ſuit ſine actu, conſequens eſt quod actu fuerit Comprehenſor, videndo Deum per eſſentiam clarius caeteris creaturis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2. But then it is as true, that Chriſt at the ſame firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherein he was <hi>Comprehenſor</hi> in reſpect of his Soul, was alſo in reſpect of the inferiour Faculties of that, and the frail mortal paſſible condition of his Fleſh, a <hi>Viator</hi> too. And this the ſame <hi>Aquinas</hi> has as expreſly determined in the ſame 3 part of his <hi>Summes</hi> q. 15. art. 10. And this is a moſt clear Scripture-truth in it ſelf. <hi>For ought not Chriſt to ſuffer,</hi> ſaies he <note place="margin">Luke 24. 26.</note> himſelf, <hi>and then to enter into his glory?</hi> And therefore <hi>for the joy that was ſet before him,</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle to the Hebrews, <hi>he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured</hi>

                  <hi>right hand of God. For though he were in the form of God, and thought it no robbery to be equal with God: yet he made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf to death, even the death of the croſs; wherefore God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hath highly exalted him.</hi> In this ſtate <hi>though he were a ſon, yet learned he obedience by the things that he ſuffered.</hi> In this ſtate <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 8.</note> he prayed for his own after-exaltation as well as ours, ſaying, <hi>Father, the hour is come, glorifie thy Son, that thy Son may alſo</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">John 17. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>glorifie thee.</hi> In this ſtate he merited (as <hi>Suarez</hi> and ſome other of the Schoolmen determine) his own exaltation in the fleſh (how truly or in what ſenſe I now determine not;) but moſt certain it is (and no man but the <hi>Socinian</hi> denies it) that he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited ours. And this is ſo clear a truth, that I think not any of the Schoolmen that write upon the <hi>third</hi> of the <hi>Sentences,</hi> or the third part of the <hi>Summes,</hi> but acknowledge it. And our <hi>Refuter</hi> himſelf, if he had but conſulted the places in <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Scotus</hi> that here he referrs to, might have found it. For <hi>Aquinas</hi> in the very next words, in his anſwer to the firſt objection ſaies, <hi>Ad primum ergo dicendum, quod ſicut ſupra dictum eſt, q.</hi> 19. <hi>art.</hi> 3. <hi>Chriſtus non meruit gloriam animae, ſecundum quam dicitur Comprehenſor, ſed gloriam corporis, ad quam per ſuam paſsionem pervenit.</hi> The anſwer in the Body of that article tert. part. q. 19. art. 3. is long, the ſumm is this; <hi>Dicendum eſt quod Chriſtus gloriam corporis, &amp; ea quae pertinent ad exteriorem ejus excellentiam (ſicut eſt Aſcenſio, Veneratio, &amp; alia hujuſmodi) habuit per meritum.</hi> And then immediately in his anſwer <hi>ad primum</hi> he ſaies, <hi>Dicendum quod fruitio, quae eſt actus Charitatis, pertinet ad gloriam animae, quam Chriſtus non meruit; &amp; ideo ſi per Charitatem aliquid meruit, non ſequitur quod idem ſit meritum &amp; praemium. Nec tamen per Charitatem me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruit in quantum erat Charitas Comprehenſoris, ſed in quantum erat Viatoris. Nam ipſe fuit ſimul &amp; Viator &amp; Comprehenſor,- ut ſupra habitum eſt q.</hi> 15. <hi>art.</hi> 10. <hi>Et ideo quia nunc non eſt Viator, non eſt in ſtatu merendi.</hi> And then as for <hi>Scotus,</hi> who in the 18th. diſtinction moſt admirably diſputes this queſtion, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trum Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus meruerit in primo inſtanti ſuae conceptionis,</hi> he founds his whole diſcourſe upon it.</p>

               <p> §. 3.

And having acknowledged the difficulty of it, he goes on to define what Merit is; and having <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Difficile videtur ſalvare quod merue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (Chriſtus,) cum fuit beatus &amp; perfecte conjunctus fini ſecundum vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatem in primo inſtanti.</hi> Scotus <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>Sent. diſt.</hi> 18. <hi>q. unica.</hi> § 4. <hi>p.</hi> 131.</note> cleared that, he proceeds to reſolve, that though the Saints and Angels in Heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are <hi>Comprehenſores,</hi> were incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Merit, yet Chriſt in the dayes of his fleſh, being not only <hi>Comprehenſor</hi> but <hi>Viator</hi> too, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he was capable of meriting at Gods hands, by <hi>Particular Covenant</hi> and <hi>Contract;</hi> and that he did indirectly at leaſt <hi>de facto</hi> merit his own exaltation in the fleſh. I ſhall, for the Reader's ſatisfaction, tranſcribe one ſhort paſſage, and refer him to the Author for the reſt. <hi>Alii beati à Chriſto, quia ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum totam voluntatem conjuncti ſunt ultimo fini, ſc.

I grant alſo that Chriſt, perfectly ſeeing God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying him in his Soul, did therefore perfectly, equally, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interuptedly Love him: this Love of his was alwaies <hi>in Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino,</hi> and at one utmoſt height, becauſe it was a Neceſſary Act, and flowed <hi>per modum Emanationis</hi> from the <hi>beatifical viſion;</hi> and impoſſible it was, that he ſhould do otherwiſe, ſince even <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> could determine, that <hi>ultimus fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> and <hi>ſummum bonum, quando cognoſcatur neceſſario a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 7. And therefore it will be now fruitleſſe, and nothing pertinent to the Debate, to enquire, whether the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> or <hi>Scotiſts</hi> are in the right, and whether the Formality of happineſs conſiſts in the Love of God, or the Beatifical viſion, or both, or whether (as I rather believe) in the Raviſhing Contentment and Delight that reſults from both, ſince moſt evident it is, that Chriſt was not only <hi>Comprehenſor</hi> but alſo <hi>Viator</hi> from the firſt moment of his Conception.</p>

And is not this now a weighty argument, well deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to be put in the <hi>Title page</hi> of the Book, to tell all the world, how Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> is ſubdued by it?

               </p>
               <p>§. 13. Now though the habit of this Love was alwaies in Chriſt full, and without any interruption even as he was <hi>Via<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor:</hi> yet the Acts that flowed from this Habit were <hi>de facto,</hi> ſome or other ſtill interrupted, becauſe his preſent finite ſtate, and condition, could not actually apply himſelf to the performance of all at once, and the acts themſelves were not all <hi>compoſſible</hi> in the ſame ſubject in one and the ſame moment, and the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Nature, at leaſt when he <hi>ſlept,</hi> required the intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome of them; and as they were of neceſſity to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, ſo of neceſſity alſo they could not be equal in themſelves, but ſome muſt be more high, more intenſe then others, becauſe of the unequal participation of the divine goodneſs, unequally ſhining in the ſeveral Objects of this Love, as we have already beyond exception demonſtrated. This interruption, this ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality in the fervour of theſe ſeveral Acts of divine Charity, no more derogates from the fulneſs of that high Act of Divine Love, he was poſſeſſed with as <hi>Comprehenſor,</hi> then the ſorrows and anguiſh of his Soul and Spirit in the inferiour Part, and the paſſible mortal condition of his fleſh did derogate from the truth of his Godhead, and the fulneſs of his happineſſe which he enjoyed as <hi>Comprehenſor.</hi> Nay ſo far it was from deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the fulneſſe of his <hi>habitual grace,</hi> that if the Acts of this Love had been all equally intenſe, his Love in the <hi>Habit</hi> had not been yet perfect, becauſe as we have ſhewn, Gods Law requires an Order in our Charity, and that we muſt love the Lord our God with all our heart, and with all our Soul, &amp;c. and our neighbours as ourſelves.</p>

But now Chriſt-man had in him as great abilities for the actual Love of God as Adam in Paradiſe; as the Saints and Angels in heaven, for an all fulneſſe of the grace and virtue of Love dwelled in him, and therefore if the inward acts of his Love were leſs intenſe at one time then another, then ſometimes, when he actually Loved God, he did not Love him as intenſely, as ardently, as fervently, as he could, he did not Love him with all his might, and ſtrength, <hi>ex toto poſſe ſuo,</hi> and ſo conſequently he fulfilled not all righteouſneſſe; for his obedience unto this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would have been by this your opinion imperfect, and ſinful, which, to imagine were blaſphemy. But you will be ready to tell me, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>§. 2. This is your Argument and the moſt ſpecious of all, but yet as little to the purpoſe as any of the reſt. And that it may ſo appear, I thus reduce it into Form.</p>
               <p>He whoſe love of God in the inward Act is more intenſe at one time then an other, breaks that firſt Commandement that enjoynes the moſt intenſe Love of God Poſſible.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt (that was impeccable) could not, did not, break that Commandement. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt's Love of God in the inward act was not more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe at one time then another.</p>
               <p>Or thus.</p>
               <p>He that had greater abilities for the Actual Love of God then <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, or the Saints and Angels in Heaven and yet
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:119243:200"/> does Love God in the inward Act more intenſely at one time then an other, he does not alwayes love God <hi>ex toto poſſe ſuo,</hi> and as much as the Law requires.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt had alwayes greater abilities for the actuall Love of God then <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, or the Saints and Angels in Heaven, and yet (as you ſay) his Love of God in the inward Act was more intenſe at one time then another. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(By conſequence according to your ſaying) he loved not God <hi>ex toto poſſe ſuo,</hi> and as much as the Law requires, which conſequence (becauſe it makes him ſinful) but to imagine were blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Chuſe you which Form you will, the force and evidence of the Argument is the ſame, and one anſwer will fit both. And I ſhall give it you in brief, and it is no more then by a denyal of your Propoſition or <hi>Major</hi> in both.</p>
               <p>§. 4. The truth is, all the ſeeming ſtrength of this Diſcourſe lies in the ambiguity of the phraſe <hi>The Love of God,</hi> which is differently underſtood by our <hi>Refuter</hi> in the <hi>premiſſes,</hi> and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> whom he oppoſes, in the <hi>Concluſion.</hi> And conſequently the Syllogiſmes conſiſt of <hi>four termes,</hi> and ſo are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> phantaſtical <hi>paralo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmes,</hi> like the Colours in the Rainbow, they make a fair ſhow <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ariſt: Elench:</hi> l. 1. c. 3.</note> indeed to the eye, but when we come to ſearch what they are, they are nothing but ſhew, and without any ſolidity.</p>
               <p>§. 5. They are both guilty of that Sophiſm, which the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the firſt of the ſix <hi>in Voce.</hi> For whereas Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> (as we have moſt demonſtratively proved, and as is alſo acknowledged in our <hi>Refuters</hi> firſt argument) takes the Phraſe, <hi>The Love of God,</hi> for the Acts of Divine Charity or holy Love in the General Notion, our <hi>Refuter</hi> here takes it; in a more reſtrained ſenſe, for that eminent Act of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Charity, that is immediatly terminated on God, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinct from theſe other Acts of Charity, whereby we love our ſelves, and our neighbors, as our ſelves. And this will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from the Tenor of the firſt Commandement, and the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:119243:201"/> that himſelf has quoted, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 37. <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 30 <hi>Thou ſhalt Love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy mind. This is the firſt and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and the ſecond is like unto it, Thou ſhalt Love thy neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> Though then it were granted, that all the Acts of our Love, immediately fixed on God, muſt be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, becauſe alwaies, by virtue of that Commandement, we muſt Love God, as highly, as intenſely as we can, yet it will not follow that all the Acts of Divine Charity, or holy Love, muſt be therefore equally intenſe. Nay becauſe it was impoſſible for the Saviour of the world to ſin, I muſt conclude that the Acts of this his Love were not, could not be equally intenſe. For then he ſhould have loved himſelf, and his Neighbour, the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite goodneſs of the <hi>Creature</hi> with the ſame equal fervency and ardor as the infinite goodneſs of the <hi>Creator,</hi> contrary to the Tenor of theſe Commandements, and the fulneſs of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours wiſdom and grace.</p>
               <p>§. 6. But then this is not all the miſadventure of our <hi>Refuter.</hi> For in the latter part of his Diſcourſe he confounds that Act of our Saviours Love of God belonging to him as <hi>Comprehenſor,</hi> with that other Act of Love, that belonged to him as <hi>Viator,</hi> and which alone is enjoyned in that firſt, and great Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now theſe two, though the <hi>Objects</hi> be the ſame, yet differ as really, as heaven in poſſeſſion, from heaven in hope and expectation. The one is a Free Act of the Will iſſuing from the <hi>Infuſed habit of Charity,</hi> the other a neceſſary Act of the Will, that flowes <hi>per modum emanationis</hi> from the <hi>beatifical viſion,</hi> as Light does from the Sun. To the one he had a proper freedome, and the Act by way of <hi>Duty</hi> fell under the authority and guidance of the firſt and great Commandement. To the other he had no more freedom, then now the Saints and Angels in heaven have; who becauſe they are already poſſeſſed of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and all that heaven can afford, are not under any Law, but as Naturally as Neceſſarily they love God, as ſince their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made <hi>perfect,</hi> they ſee him there.</p>
               <p>§. 7. And now though this be ſufficient to demonſtrate the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:119243:201"/> weakneſs of our <hi>Refuters</hi> Diſcourſe, yet for the full ſatisfaction of the Engliſh Reader, who is moſt likely to be deceived with theſe Falſe Lights, and empty ſhewes, I ſhall take his whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe aſunder, that ſo I may ſever Truth from Falſhood, and vain aerial ſhapes, and Appearances from ſolid Bodies.</p>
               <p>§. 8. Firſt then I grant that it was impoſſible for Chriſt to ſin; <hi>For ſuch a high Prieſt became us, who is holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners, and made higher then the heaven.</hi> Heb. 7. 26. When not only <hi>Pilates</hi> Wife calls him <hi>that juſt man,</hi> but even his very adverſaries and accuſers were not able to <hi>convince</hi> him, and his Judge does publickly acquit him; when <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who has commanded his followers to oppoſe and perſecute his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, has yet in his very <hi>Alcoran</hi> declared him to be a moſt holy man, and the next great Prophet ſent from God, and therefore condemnes his own followers that blaſpheme him; for us <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that acknowledge him our Saviour, either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or indirectly to pull the glorious Crown of Righteouſneſs from his head, is moſt hideous and protentous blaſphemy. And therefore I ſhall as readily, as cheerfully, as our <hi>Refuter,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce <hi>Anathema</hi> to all ſuch Concluſions, that caſt the leaſt Umbrage and ſuſpition of guilt upon our ever bleſſed Saviour. And ſo I undertake ſhall Doctor <hi>Hammond;</hi> and I am bold to promiſe our <hi>Refuter</hi> his thanks, and moſt grateful acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if at any time he ſhall reclaim him from any ſuch dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, though by himſelf undiſcovered, Inferences.</p>
               <p>§. 9. But then ſecondly, I muſt adde, that becauſe Chriſt was abſolutely <hi>impeccable,</hi> and could not ſin, therefore of neceſſity the Inward Acts of his Love, and holy Charity could not be of the ſame equal Intenſeneſs, but muſt differ in <hi>gradual Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> according to the Order of Charity that Gods Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, and the different <hi>Participation</hi> of the Divine goodneſs in the ſeveral Objects of this Love.</p>
               <p>§. 10. Thirdly I grant, that the firſt and great Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enjoynes us the moſt intenſe Actual Love of God, that is
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:119243:202"/> poſſible; command us it does, to love God <hi>tanto nixu &amp; cona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu, quanto fieri poteſt,</hi> with our utmoſt force and endeavour, and with as high a degree of Actual Love as is poſſible for us to reach unto.</p>
               <p>§. 11. But then fourthly, I muſt deny that it will follow that even the Acts of this Love, this high tranſcendent Love, that is immediately fixed on God, are all equally intenſe, though the Ardor of them muſt be ſtill as intenſe, as we are able. For ſince as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Bernard, Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Scotus</hi> ſay truly, that this commandement, in that ſenſe, cannot perfectly be fulfilled in this life, but it ſhall be then only in Heaven, when man ſhall be <hi>totally</hi> united, and joyned to God, by virtue of the <hi>beatifical viſion,</hi> when God ſhall be all in all; ſince alſo it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that this firſt and great Commandement obliges us to love God only <hi>with all our ſtrength,</hi> and not with more, then ever we had at firſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> before his fall; and ſince it is alſo evident, that <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, had not the ſame Abilities to love God in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> as the ſoul of the ſame <hi>Adam,</hi> and the <hi>Spirits of</hi> all <hi>juſt men</hi> now <hi>made perfect</hi> have in Heaven; and ſince it is alſo as evident (as I ſhall alſo by and by, and beyond all exception, further demonſtrate) that Chriſt as conſidered in the ſtate of a <hi>Viator,</hi> had not the ſame Abilities to know and love God, as he had at the ſame time as conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſtate of a <hi>Comprehenſor,</hi> and fully poſſeſſed of heaven happineſſe, and the full ſight and <hi>Viſion,</hi> and enjoyment and <hi>fruition</hi> of God; it will undenyably follow that even in the Acts of this high tranſcendent Love of God, there was, and muſt be acknowledged a Gradual difference in reſpect of Ardor and Intenſeneſſe, according to the difference of his Abilities as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the ſtate of a <hi>Viator,</hi> and as conſidered in the ſtate of a <hi>Comprehenſor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 12. Fifthly I grant that <hi>Chriſt</hi> as Man had in his humane ſoul, as conſidered in the ſtate of a <hi>Comprehenſor,</hi> in the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour part of it, the Mind, farr greater abilities for the Actual Love of God, then <hi>Adam</hi> had in <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> becauſe from the firſt Moment of his Conception, and Birth, by virtue
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:119243:202"/> of the <hi>hypoſtatical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> he had greater Abilities for this Love, then all the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> in heaven. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I do alſo grant, that the inward Acts of this his Love, as <hi>Comprehenſor,</hi> were alwaies One, without any Interruption, or Gradual Variation; theſe were alwaies at the height, and the ſame equal intenſeneſſe; becauſe they were alwaies <hi>in Termino,</hi> and not free Acts of the Will, but Neceſſary effects of the <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical Viſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 13. But then ſixthly I muſt add, what our <hi>Refuter</hi> ha's in his <hi>Mixture</hi> of <hi>Scholastical Divinity with Practical</hi> told us <note place="margin">Jeanes mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture pag. 261.</note> concerning our bleſſed Saviour, as conſidered in the ſtate of a Viator. <q>
                     <hi>That it is not to be denyed, but that by ſpecial diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation there was ſome reſtraint of the influence of his happineſſe or beatifical viſion in the whole courſe of his humiliation, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the time of his doleful pasſion. But</hi> (though) <hi>truly</hi> (as he addes immediately) <hi>it ſeemes very improbable, and no waies ſortable unto the ſtate of Chriſts bleſſedneſſe, for his grace and holineſſe, the Image of God in him, his love of God, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> (to wit in the habit as theſe Phraſes ſignifie) <hi>to be lyable to perpetual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and augmentation,</hi> yet becauſe, (let me add) his Abilities during this reſtraint of the Influence of his happineſſe, and as conſidered in the ſtate of a <hi>Viator,</hi> were not the ſame, as now they are in the ſtate of a <hi>Comprehenſor,</hi> the Intenſeneſſe and Ardor in the Acts of his Love now, muſt be higher then they were during that Reſtraint. But much more muſt this be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there was a Gradual difference in the Acts of his Love, if, as our <hi>Refuter</hi> in his <hi>Mixture</hi> undertakes to demonſtrate, that <note place="margin">Jeanes his mixture p. 250</note> 
                  <hi>our Saviour did as truly increaſe in the inward Acts of Wiſdom and Grace, as he did in Stature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 14. But then ſeventhly let me add, that, if the Inward Acts of this Love of God were not alwaies equal, but did Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually differ, becauſe they did Gradually increaſe, it will not therefore follow that our Saviour muſt be concluded guilty, (with all humble reverence be it ſpoken) of the breach of the firſt and great Commandement. For he that alwaies loves God <hi>with all his Soul, and might and ſtrength,</hi> that loves him to the
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:119243:203"/> utmoſt of his ability, that he ha's by Gods gift, and not weakened by ſin nor impaired by his own fault, loves him <hi>pro praeſenti ſtatu,</hi> as much as that Law does require; and if, as his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities do increaſe, his Love does conſtantly ſtill increaſe, he ſtill loves God according to <hi>that duty</hi> and meaſure, which that Law does require, though the Acts of this Love are now more intenſe, than they were formerly And thus it was in Chriſt, at leaſt as compared in the ſtate of a <hi>Viator</hi> with himſelf as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the ſtate of a <hi>Comprehenſor.</hi> The Acts then of this his Love were alwaies holy, and moſt conformable to Gods Law, and ſtill <hi>in ſuo genere</hi> perfect, though they were not all equal in Gradual Intenſeneſſe, and all ſimply and abſolutely perfect, as now they are, where he ſits at the Right hand of God. And therefore, even in reſpect of theſe Acts, it will not follow that, though they were not alwaies equal in gradual perfection, his Obedience to this Commandement was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore imperfect, becauſe he did alwaies love God <hi>ex toto poſſe ſuo,</hi> with all his might and ſtrength, which ſtrength did differ according to the variety of his ſeveral ſtates and conditions, as <hi>Viator</hi> and <hi>Comprehenſor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 15. But then laſtly, let me add, to prevent all miſtakes, that this is not by me applyed to any but onely our <hi>Saviour,</hi> that was ſtill <hi>holy, harmleſſe, undefiled.</hi> For God is not, cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, if by virtue of this Law he ſhould require us to love him according to the Abilities he gave us, and we have wilfully loſt and ſquandered away: nor can we be ſaid to love God <hi>with all our might and with all our ſtrength,</hi> though in this lapſed depraved condition we love him as well as we can with this <hi>body of ſin</hi> we carry about us, becauſe it is by our own default that we can now love him no better, and we our ſelves by our own ſin and wilful default have diſabled our ſelves, that we cannot love him ſo well as we ought, and as Gods Law requires; and which we might have kept, if <hi>Adam</hi> and we his off-ſpring had continued in our firſt <hi>innocency.</hi> But then alſo let me add, that <hi>we</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>innocency</hi> ſhould not have loved God with that height and ardor as now the <hi>Spirits of juſt men made perfect</hi> do love him, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; they knew &amp; ſhould have known
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:119243:203"/> him only by <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Revelation,</hi> but now they know him <hi>face to face,</hi> and their love is inlarged by the greatneſſe of their happineſſe and the fulneſſe of their glory.</p>
               <p>§. 16. I ſhall clear all this by the <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> of ſome School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of great note and worth in themſelves, and of great repute with our <hi>Refuter.</hi> I begin with <hi>Suarez.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 17. He, in his firſt Tome on the third part of <hi>Aquinas Summes,</hi> diſputing of the Merit of Chriſt, laies it down for a ground, that Chriſt <hi>in the dayes of his fleſh</hi> and in the ſtate of a <hi>Viator,</hi> was truly <hi>in ſtatu merendi,</hi> and that all the conditions requiſite to make an Action <hi>meritorius,</hi> and the Perſon that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes it to merit by it, were to be found in him.

<pb n="368" facs="tcp:119243:205"/> another paſſage in the ſame Author, and the ſame Treatiſe, diſp. 37. ſect. 4. p. 518. But it is quoted after, and thither I refer the Reader.</p>
               <p>§. 19. To give the ſum of this diſcourſe from <hi>Suarez.</hi> Firſt, plain it is, that Chriſt in the daies of his Fleſh was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Viator,</hi> and <hi>in ſtatu merendi.</hi> Secondly, It is eſſentiall to <hi>Merit,</hi> that the <hi>Meritorious Act</hi> be freely and voluntarily performed. Thirdly, Chriſt did truly merit, otherwiſe we muſt deny him to be the Meritorious Cauſe of our Salvation, and turn downright <hi>Socinians.</hi> Fourthly, He merited not only by the Inward Acts of that Love which was the conſequent of his ſupernaturally infuſed knowledge of God, but alſo by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Acts of Charity and Love to his own Glory, and his Love to us Men his Neighbors, and all Inward Acts of all Virtues and Graces, whether <hi>Infuſed</hi> or <hi>Acquiſite,</hi> as alſo by thoſe other free Acts of his Will of a more inferiour Alloy, ſuch as <hi>Suarez</hi> calls <hi>ordinis naturalis,</hi> his Natural Love of God. Since then that all theſe were not, could not be equal in themſelves, and with that high tranſcendent Act of his Love that was immediately, yet freely, ſeated upon God, it neceſſarily follows, that as he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited by them all, though all were not of the ſame height and Gradual Perfection, ſo he was not, cannot be concluded guilty of the breach of the firſt and great Commandement, though they differed from one another in gradual perfection, becauſe he truly did merit by every one of them. <hi>Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>§. 20. But then though this be abundantly ſufficient to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit the Doctors aſſertion from the leaſt ſuſpition and umbrage of that ſo <hi>dangerous crimination,</hi> yet I ſhall further demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate it from our <hi>Refuters</hi> own Conceſſions, and that ſo clearly that either, <hi>Sampſon-</hi>like, he muſt involve himſelf as well as his adverſary in the ſame common ruine, or elſe <hi>retract</hi> his ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable aſperſion.</p>
               <p>For firſt, in his <hi>Mixture</hi> he expreſly grants that <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <note place="margin">Jeanes his mixture of Scholaſtical, &amp;c. p 261.</note> 
                  <hi>daies of his Fleſh</hi> was not <hi>purè Comprehenſor,</hi> but alſo <hi>Viator;</hi> and if he ſhould not, he muſt contradict the Scriptures, that in many places aſſert it.</p>
               <pb n="369" facs="tcp:119243:205"/>
               <p> Secondly, he expreſly grants that <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>daies of his fleſh</hi> did as <hi>truly</hi> grow in the <hi>Inward Acts</hi> of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <note place="margin">Jeanes Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt. <hi>p.</hi> 249, 250. Jeanes Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt. <hi>p.</hi> 261.</note> 
                  <hi>actuai apprehenſion</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> as he did in <hi>Stature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, he ſaies, <hi>It is not to be denyed, but that by ſpecial di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation there was ſome reſtraint of his happineſs or beatifical viſion in the whole courſe of his humiliation, and particularly in the time of his doleful paſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 21. From hence I argue that if Chriſt did truly and not in Appearance grow and receive Increaſe in the Inward Acts of Wiſedom and Grace, then the utmoſt height and degree of Actual Grace and holy Love is not alwaies <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by that firſt and great Commandement; becauſe Chriſt was <hi>impeccable,</hi> and it was impoſſible for him to ſin.</p>
               <p>§. 22. Secondly, I argue that if Chriſt was truly <hi>Viator</hi> in the daies of his fleſh, then as <hi>Viator,</hi> and in that ſtate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, he could not love God ſo highly, ſo ardently, by virtue of the <hi>infuſed Habit</hi> of divine Love, as he did as conſidered in the ſtate of a <hi>Comprehenſor,</hi> or as now he does at the right hand of God; becauſe, as our <hi>Refuter</hi> maintaines from <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Bernard, Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Scotus,</hi> this Precept of Loving God perfectly, cannot be fulfilled in this life, but only <hi>in Patria, quando Deus erit omnia in omnibus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 23. Thirdly, I argue that if Chriſt as Viator had not, could not have the ſame Abilities to love God with the ſame fervour and ardency as he has as <hi>Comprehenſor,</hi> therefore there muſt of neceſſity be a gradual difference in the Acts of his Love as <hi>Comprehenſor</hi> and <hi>Viator,</hi> becauſe our <hi>Refuter</hi> has told us in his firſt Argument from <hi>Hurtado,</hi> that <hi>Intenſio actus ſecundi ſupponit aequalem intenſionem in actu primo, cum actus ſecundus ſupponit primum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 24. And now that the <hi>Viator</hi> differs in Abilities from the <hi>Comprehenſor,</hi> as it is clear to any that underſtands the very terms, ſo plain alſo it is, becauſe the <hi>Viator</hi> knows God and his Goodneſs only by <hi>Infuſed</hi> knowledge and <hi>Revelation,</hi> and the other by <hi>Actual Apprehenſion;</hi> the one only <hi>taſts</hi> and <hi>ſees</hi>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:119243:206"/> 
                  <hi>how good</hi> he is by <hi>Grace,</hi> and the other actually enjoyes him by <hi>fruition</hi> in <hi>Glory.</hi> And ſince our Love muſt ſtill be proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our Knowledge, the more we ſee and injoy God, the more are we enabled, and the more perfectly we love God. <hi>For we know in part, and we propheſie in part. But when that which</hi>

For now we ſee through a glaſs darkly, but then face to face: now I know in part, but then ſhall I know even as I alſo am known.</hi> Nor can our <hi>Refuter</hi> deny but this muſt in ſome meaſure agree to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the ſtate of a <hi>Viator,</hi> though alwaies abſolutely ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as well as it does to us, to whom <hi>he was made like in all</hi>

                  <hi>hath ſeen or can ſee,</hi> as conſidered in this ſtate. And hence it is that our Saviour <note n="(a)" place="margin">John 17. 1, 5.</note> praies for his <hi>glorification</hi> in this ſtate; and in this ſtate <note n="(b)" place="margin">Heb. 12. 2.</note>

                  <hi>thus it firſt behooved him to ſuffer, and then to enter into his glory.</hi> Beſides, if <hi>in the ſtate of his Humiliation there was by ſpecial diſpenſation,</hi> as our <hi>Refuter</hi> grants, a <hi>reſtraint of his happineſs or beatifical viſion,</hi> he could not then ſee God ſo perfectly, and ſo perfectly enjoy him, as after his Glorification when there was no Reſtraint; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently his Love could not be ſo ardent, ſo highly intenſe and perfect as afterwards, when now he ſits at the right hand of God.</p>

For though all were granted that he labours to prove, and that Chriſt did love God <hi>ex toto poſſe ſuo,</hi> with as high a degree of <hi>actual</hi> love as he was able to reach to, as I moſt readily grant; yet for all that it will not follow that even this Act of divine Love was, or could be, equal in gradual perfection, with that other Act of his Love that he exerciſed as <hi>Comprehenſor;</hi> much leſſe will it follow, that all the other Acts of holy Charity and Vertue and Grace, were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual in Gradual Perfection among themſelves, or with this high tranſcendent Act of Love, immediately fixed on
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:119243:207"/> God, as we have evidently demonſtrated.</p>
               <p>§. 27. Howſoever, that he may not ſay that any part of his Reaſon and skill in <hi>School-learning</hi> is neglected, I ſhall gratifie him ſo farr as to conſider this alſo. But then I cannot chuſe but obſerve, that ſince theſe three following Leaves are nothing at all to the enforcement of his Argument, but only tending to prove that which was never yet denyed him, at leaſt in this controverſie, our <hi>Refuter</hi> could have no other deſign in this <hi>extravagance,</hi> but only to <hi>amuſe</hi> the Reader, and to bring the Doctor in ſuſpicion, as if this his Aſſertion, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the whole Treatiſe of <hi>Will-worſhip,</hi> and the <hi>Defence</hi> of it againſt Mr. <hi>Cawdry,</hi> were <hi>Popiſhly</hi> affected, and that the main Pillar of it was borrowed from <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> whom <hi>Ames</hi> and <hi>Chamier</hi> and our <hi>White</hi> have already confuted; and that <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Scotus,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Bernard,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Scripture</hi> were all oppoſite to Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> as well as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in this aſſertion.

               <p>§. 1. But how know you the Doctors mind, Sir, that he <hi>will be ready thus to tell you?</hi> For ſuppoſe he could give you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwer to your argument, as you ſee I have done. What need then had the Doctor to borrow this anſwer from his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of <hi>Will-worſhip?</hi> Sir, though you are ſo barren of Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that in every leaf almoſt of this <hi>Reply</hi> you give the Reader
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:119243:208"/> the ſame argument; yet he that ſhall peruſe the Doctors wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, will find that this is not his <hi>cuſtom,</hi> and that if he be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſpeak to the ſame ſubject, he ſtill enriches his diſcourſe with New Obſervations to the <hi>profit</hi> and <hi>contentment</hi> of his Reader.

               <p>§. 2. The truth is, Sir, that as the Doctor has no need to make uſe of that anſwer here; ſo there he gave it to farr dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent purpoſes, namely, to ſhew that he who loves God <hi>with all his heart,</hi> may yet have room left for a <hi>Voluntary Oblation,</hi> notwithſtanding that <hi>precept.</hi> And therefore I muſt conclude that as this is brought in by the <hi>head</hi> and <hi>ſhoulders,</hi> ſo it is not an anſwer to Doctor <hi>Hammond's Ecteneſteron,</hi> but a fling at the Treatiſe of <hi>Will-worſhip,</hi> which yet, like <hi>Canis ad Nilum,</hi> you but touch at, and inſtantly you are gone for fear a <hi>Crocodile</hi> ſhould meet you.</p>
               <p>§. 3.

               <p>§. 4. I thought, Sir, you had wholy engroſſed this office of <hi>Dictator</hi> to your ſelf. And the Doctor of any man will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon it. But if you had been pleaſed to have dealt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially with your Reader, and acquainted him with the grounds and occaſion of the anſwer, and reported it full and entire, as it lay in that Treatiſe, he could have had no <hi>Reaſon to expect a further confirmation</hi> then what the Doctor there deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>§. 5. So ſatisfactory indeed the reaſons were, that Mr. <hi>Caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry</hi> himſelf, in his Exercitation on that very Treatiſe and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph,</hi> acknowledges and yields all that is now in conteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Doctor and you. <hi>For let it be ſuppoſed,</hi> ſaies he, <hi>yea granted, that ſincere Love is capable of Degrees, whether in the</hi>

                  <hi>whom the ſuppoſition is made do both obey the precept, then they do not offend againſt it: and if they do not offend againſt it, then is not this faulty or in vitio; for ſure every fault or vice muſt be a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law.</hi> And if, as he ſaies, that Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement require of all men that <hi>Perfection</hi> of Love that is abſolutely ſinleſs, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident it is that the utmoſt <hi>Sincerity</hi> of Love, that as himſelf grants implies <hi>Degrees,</hi> and therefore neceſſarily ſuppoſes Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſin, cannot be the fulfilling of it: nor would <hi>Adam's</hi> ſincerity, ſuppoſing his Fall, have ever been accepted, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the Curſe and his eternal damnation, if no new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant had been made.

For it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible the ſame Law ſhould at one and the ſame inſtant be both obeyed and tranſgreſſed by one and the ſame Perſon in one and the ſame reſpect. And if he ſpeak of <hi>ſeveral</hi> reſpects, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſeveral Obligations and Covenants, he doth but confuſedly beat the Ayr, and deceive himſelf and his Reader, and what he grants with the one hand he takes away with the other.</p>

               <p>§. 15. And thus we ſee no leſs then four or five very ſevere Criminations are in this and the former Paragraph laid to the Doctors charge by our <hi>Refuter,</hi> and not one of them is proved but only by his own <hi>venerable authority.</hi> Conſider, Sir, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, do not you here barely <hi>dictate?</hi> What proof have you offered us of any one charge? Let us muſter them up.</p>
               <pb n="382" facs="tcp:119243:212"/>
               <p> 1. You lay it to the Doctors charge, that he borrowed this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition from <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and that it is to be found in the places by you quoted.</p>
               <p>2ly. That in this the Doctor is guilty of <hi>Compliance</hi> with <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3ly. That thoſe <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that have dealt in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies betwixt us and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have proved this ſenſe too narrow.</p>
               <p>4ly. They have given another expoſition of the words, which they have confirmed and vindicated from the exceptions of the <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5ly. That Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> has taken no notice of all this, but without all equity has troubled his Reader with that which hath been ſo abundantly refuted by <hi>Proteſtant</hi> pens.</p>
               <p>§. 16. Now for the proof of all theſe we have our <hi>Refuters</hi> own word, and two citations of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and one place quoted from <hi>Chamier</hi> in the Margin, which yet through his over great haſt is miſtaken; for it is not in the xvi chapter, but the xiv of that book, which figures our <hi>Refuters</hi> haſty eye did very eaſily miſtake. And I am perſwaded that if he had ſat down and well weighed that Chapter, and the deſign and ſcope of that learned man, he would never have made uſe of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority againſt the Doctor, that ſpeaks every thing that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to make good againſt <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 17. And now to acquit the Doctor from theſe Criminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I conceive it neceſſary to lay down the Doctors anſwer at large, and to acquaint the Reader with the ground and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of it, and what he has added further to it in his Reply to Mr. <hi>Cawdrey.</hi> And then I doubt not but our <hi>Refuters</hi> ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and fair carriage will appear to the moſt ordinary Capacity.

                     <hi>The Occaſion of the Doctors expoſition of the firſt great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of Love. The Reaſons of his fundamental Poſition in ſhort.

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. And it is this. The Doctor in in his Treatiſe of <hi>Will-worſhip</hi> having undertaken to vindicate the true Notion of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> from the ordinary <hi>miſpriſion</hi> and contempt that was <hi>vulgarly</hi> thrown upon it, layes this down for his <hi>ground,</hi> that there were certain <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> to which no man by any <hi>particular Law</hi> was obliged, which yet when they were <hi>ſpontaneouſly</hi> and <hi>voluntarily</hi> performed were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by God, and accepted of him as <hi>Free will-offerings</hi> over and above what the <hi>Law</hi> in <hi>Particular</hi> required. Treat. of Will-worſhip, ſect. 9.</p>
               <p>§. 2. And this he proves by diverſe Arguments.</p>
               <p>As firſt, by the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>free-will-offerings</hi> under the <hi>Law.</hi> ſect. 29. and before.</p>
               <p>Secondly from the Sect of the <hi>Haſidaei</hi> mentioned and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 1 Macc. 2. 42. Which, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Proteſtant <hi>Scaliger,</hi> were men that in their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence performed ſomething which the <hi>Law</hi> required not. Section 28.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, from <hi>Davids</hi> Pious intention and magnificent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to build a Temple to the Lord, which was very acceptable to God, though no where commanded. Sect. 30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 36.</p>
               <pb n="384" facs="tcp:119243:213"/>
               <p> Fourthly, from Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching the Goſpel <hi>gratis</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,,</hi> when he might by <hi>Goſpel-law</hi> have exacted his wages as the other Apoſtles did. Sect. 30.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, from the ſame Apoſtles <hi>voluntary</hi> going up to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> when bonds expected him, which perſecution he might as innocently have declined as in other caſes he had done, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it by our Saviours own example. Sect. 31.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, from the Liberal mans <hi>munificence</hi> and bounty to the poor above that <hi>proportion</hi> which by any particular Law he is obliged to. Sect. 32.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, from thoſe proſtrations and humble geſtures and frequency in <hi>Prayer,</hi> beyond what any Law determined. Sect. 33, 34.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, from the different <hi>improvements</hi> of the ſeveral <hi>talents</hi> and graces which God boſtowes upon us, and the <hi>proportionable</hi> rewards according to thoſe improvements. Sect. 39.</p>
               <p>§. 3. And now as all theſe have been ſufficiently there proved and clearly vindicated from the exceptions of Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> in the Doctors <hi>Account</hi> of his <hi>Triplex Diatribe:</hi> ſo if any one of them be demonſtrative (as without doubt ſome one of them at leaſt is, and is ſo acknowledged by Mr. <hi>Cawdrey)</hi> the whole cauſe is gained, and it will evidently ſollow, that all men are not <hi>bound</hi> to the performance of every <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> or <hi>Piety</hi> that is highly <hi>acceptable</hi> to God when it is performed, nor to do it in ſuch a <hi>degree,</hi> even when they are obliged <hi>ad ſpeciem,</hi> or that the things be done, which was the <hi>utmoſt</hi> the Doctor undertook in this Controverſie either againſt Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> or the <hi>Refuter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 4. And therefore I muſt make bold to return him his own language and tell him, it had been <hi>highly equitable</hi> for him to have taken notice of theſe Reaſons and thoſe other the Doctor added <hi>ex abundanti</hi> in the Cloſe of his anſwer to the Objection,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:119243:213"/> which our <hi>Refuter</hi> now carps at, and firſt demonſtrated the weakneſs of them, which yet Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> has not, before he had inſinuated to his <hi>Reader,</hi> that he had juſt reaſon to <hi>expect a Confirmation of what the Doctor there had ſaid</hi> in his anſwer to the Objection.</p>
               <p>§. 5. And therefore being already ſecured of the Cauſe by our <hi>Refuters</hi> crafty <hi>tergiverſation,</hi> I ſhall the more confidently attempt his ſeveral <hi>Criminations.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>§. 1.

               <p>
                  <hi>I anſwer that that Phraſe</hi> (Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy <note place="margin">Treat. of Will-worſhip, §. 49.</note> God with all thy heart, with all thy Soul, &amp;c.) <hi>denoteth two things only. Firſt, the ſincerity of this love of God, as oppoſed to Partial divided Love or Service; Secondly, the loving him above all other things, and not admitting any thing into competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him, not loving any thing elſe in ſuch a degree: and in neither of theſe reſpects excluding all other things from a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate place in our Love Which being ſuppoſed, it will be eaſie to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that this ſincere Love of God above all is capable of degrees, and that it is poſſible for two men to love God with all their hearts, i. e. ſincerely and above all things, and ſo both to obey the praecept, and yet one to love him in a more intenſe degree then the other doth (which may be obſerved amongſt the Angels themſelves, the Seraphims being ſo called becauſe they are more ardent in Zeal then other Angels;) nay, for the ſame Perſon conſtantly to Love God above all, and yet to have higher expreſſions of that Love at one time then at another. Thus we read of Chriſt himſelf Luke</hi> 22. 24. <hi>(who we know did never fail in performing what was man's duty in prayer or any thing elſe, yet) that he at that time prayed more earneſtly; which is a demonſtrative evidence that the lower degree is not neceſſarily ſinful, when the higher is acceptable to God: which when it is granted, there is no doubt but theſe free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will-offerings will be reconcilable with that Command, and he that loves God with all his heart, may have ſome poſſibility of loving God better then yet he doth, and ſo ſome room left for a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary oblation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 5. To this, for a further clearing and unfolding his mind, the Doctor thought fit in his Reply to Mr. <hi>Cawdrey's Triplex Diatribe</hi> to add theſe two things.</p>
               <pb n="390" facs="tcp:119243:216"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>To the firſt branch of his anſwer,</hi> (The ſincerity of this Love of God as oppoſed to partial divided Love) <hi>I now add, ſaies the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> Account of Mr. <hi>Cawdrey's</hi> Triplex Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribe, c. 6. ſect. 9 §. 1. p. 221. <hi>Ibid.</hi> §. 5. p. 222.</note> 
                  <hi>Doctor, for further explication, that what we do according to the precepts of Gods Law, we do out of Love toward God, not hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritically, or as by conſtraint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2ly. He ſayes, <hi>Still it muſt be remembred that it is not the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perfection we ſpeak of, when we ſay it conſiſts in a latitude, and hath degrees, but ſincerity of this or that vertue, expreſt in this or that performance: and as this, though it excludes not all mixture of ſin in the</hi> ſuppoſitum <hi>(the man in whom it is) yet may by the grace of God in Chriſt exclude it in this or that Act. For it is certain that I may in an Act of Mercy give as much as any Law obligeth me to give, and ſo not ſin in giving too little.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 6. To which let me now add what the Doctor had before delivered in his Treatiſe of <hi>Will-worſhip,</hi> Sect. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>—When in the ſervice of God a man out of a pious affection (of hope and gratitude inciting to do things acceptable to God, as well as of fear deterring him from all that is prohihited) ſhall, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to Gods general commands and the Doctrine of the Goſpel, do any thing elſe beſides what God hath commanded by any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular precept, this Action of his is to be accounted ſo much more commendable and acceptable to God. Piety being one of thoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi> quarum tantae ſunt amplitudines, ut quanto auctiores ſunt, tanto ſunt laudatiores, <hi>which have ſuch width of compaſs, that the larger they are, they are alſo ſo much more commendable; and withall the more voluntary and ſpontaneous, the more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. To which that of the Son of</hi> Sirach <hi>is agreeable,</hi> Ecclus. 43. 30. When you glorifie the Lord, exalt him as much as you can, for even he yet will far exceed; and when you exalt him, put forth all your ſtrength, for you can never go farr enough: <hi>i. e. how farr ſoever you exceed the particular command, you are yet within the compaſs of the general, and in reſpect of that can never be thought to have done enough, though the particular act or degree of it be ſomewhat, that you are not particularly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="391" facs="tcp:119243:216"/>
               <p> §. 7. Laſtly, I ſhall add one thing more from the Doctors <hi>Annotations</hi> on this commandement, Matth. 22. 37. and then I doubt not but his expoſition will appear ſo full and compleat, that it will be beyond all exception. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind, that is</hi> (ſayes the Doctor,) <hi>with all thy Will and Affections and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 8. And thus having repreſented the Doctors anſwer full and entire, and given his true ſenſe and meaning of it from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of his writings, I ſhall now be ſo bold as to challenge our <hi>Refuter</hi> to make good any one of thoſe ſevere Criminations he has laid to the Doctors charge. And if he cannot prove them (as without doubt he cannot) he is bound in Juſtice to make the Doctor reparations for the injury he has done him by a publick <hi>Recantation.</hi> And as this is moſt equitable and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, ſo he has under his hand <hi>promiſed</hi> it in the very entrance <note place="margin">Jeanes p. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> of this <hi>Reply.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 9. But now I undertake to demonſtrate that you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly abuſed the Doctor, and laid that to his charge he is no way guilty of, and therefore I expect that you make good your engagement, otherwiſe I muſt accuſe you not only of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian</hi> dealing, but alſo of <hi>breach</hi> of <hi>promiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 10. You tell us, <hi>this very anſwer is the ſhift of Papiſts in ſeveral controverſies between them and us,</hi> and for this you cite <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> But who is there that ſhall compare the places in <hi>Bellarmine</hi> you have quoted with the Doctors Expoſition, that will not clearly perceive the vaſt difference between them? It is true indeed that whatſoever is <hi>good</hi> in <hi>Bellarmines</hi> expoſition, the Doctor approves of: and for this he has the Authority and allowance of the learned <hi>Chamier,</hi> and our <hi>Ames,</hi> and the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Scripture</hi> to juſtifie him. But then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, whatſoever is juſtly <hi>wanting</hi> in <hi>Bellarmine's</hi> anſwer, and is ſo taxed for his <hi>defect</hi> by <hi>Chamier</hi> and <hi>Ames,</hi> is <hi>ſupplied</hi> in the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:119243:217"/> Doctors: And thirdly, whatſoever is purely <hi>erroneous</hi> and <hi>Popiſh</hi> in this anſwer of <hi>Bellarmine's,</hi> is either not to be found in the Doctors anſwer, or <hi>ex profeſſo</hi> declared againſt.</p>
               <p>§. 11. The ſum of <hi>Bellarmine's</hi> anſwer conſiſts in this, That to love God <hi>from the heart</hi> is to love him <hi>truly</hi> and without <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation,</hi> and that the other words were added for the <hi>height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of the expreſſion. 2ly. that to love God with all <hi>our might and ſtrength and heart</hi> is to love him <hi>pro virili,</hi> with might and main, ſo that God may have the <hi>chief place</hi> in our Love, ſo that nothing may either be <hi>preferred</hi> before him or <hi>equalled</hi> to him in this our affection. And this is all he allowes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in this Commandement. And conſequently from thence he inferrs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That none but <hi>mortal ſins</hi> are inconſiſtent with that Love that is required in this Commandement.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>venial ſins,</hi> and the <hi>Involuntary motions</hi> and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the groſſeſt ſinners of Infidelity, Blaſphemy, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, &amp;c. are not oppoſite to it</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it is poſſible to fulfil this Commandement <hi>perfectly</hi> in this <hi>life,</hi> and keep all the Commandements of God implyed in it and depending on it, ſo that a man may in <hi>Juſtice</hi> not only <hi>merit</hi> from God, but alſo <hi>ſupererogate,</hi> and do more then this or any Law of God elſe does require, and therefore upon this ſcore may deſerve and expect a brighter <hi>aureola</hi> and Crown of glory at Gods hands, then if he had done no more then the Law does require. And as this was the only venome of <hi>Popery</hi> to be found in <hi>Bellarmine's</hi> anſwer, ſo for the maintenance of theſe errors is <hi>Bellarmine's</hi> anſwer artificially framed. And as theſe are the <hi>ſhifts of Papiſts in the ſeveral controverſies between them and us,</hi> ſo the Doctor is ſo farr from any <hi>Compliance</hi> with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or any other <hi>Papiſt</hi> in the world in theſe and the like <hi>ſhifts,</hi> that his anſwer and expoſition does not only over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw them, but he has expreſly declared his opinion againſt them, and fully vindicated his expoſition from having any thing to do with them, as is plain to be ſeen in the Treatiſe of <hi>Will worſhip</hi> in the Sections immediately following the Doctors anſwer, and <hi>ex proſeſſo</hi> added to prevent this Calumny, § 50.

And therefore it had been very <hi>equitable</hi> that our Refuter ſhould have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice at leaſt of the Doctors <hi>praeoccupation</hi> and <hi>Apologetical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> carefully affixed to <hi>prevent</hi> this and the like <hi>Calumnies,</hi> before he had ſo injuriouſly defamed and aſperſed him.</p>
               <p>§. 12. If our <hi>Refuter</hi> ſhall here reply, Does not <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſay, <hi>That this Commandement enjoynes us to love God ſincerely, that is truly and from the heart, not ſeignedly and without diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> Does he not alſo ſay, <hi>that we muſt love God with the chiefeſt Love, not preferring any thing above him or admitting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing into competition with him?</hi> And does not Doctor <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond ſay the ſame? And was it not fit that he ſhould acquaint us with thoſe cogent reaſons that neceſſitated him to this compliance with Papiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 13. I anſwer, It is true Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> both ſay ſo; and ſo does <hi>Ames</hi> and <hi>Chamier,</hi> and the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Scripture</hi> ſay the ſame.</p>
               <p>§. 14. For as to the firſt, does not the Apoſtle expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and enjoyn that <hi>Love be without diſſimulation?</hi> Rom. 12. 9. does he not commend the <hi>Romans</hi> becauſe <hi>they had obeyed from the heart the form and doctrine which was delivered unto them?</hi> Rom. 6. 17. Is not this truth and ſimplicity and purity and ſingleneſs of heart every where required, and counterfeit and hypocritical ſhewes every where condemned? Eph. 6. 5, 6. Heb. 10. 22. 1 Pet. 1. 22.</p>
               <p>§. 15. And then as to the ſecond, Does not our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſay, Matth. 10. 37, 38. <hi>He that loveth Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more then me is not worthy of me?</hi> and <hi>he that taketh not his Croſs and followeth after me, is not worthy of me?</hi> Does he not alſo ſay, Luke 14. 26. <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not his Father and Mother, and Wife and Children, and Brethren and</hi>

And ſaies not alſo the Doctor the ſame in his <hi>Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> on <hi>Matthew?</hi> Sayes he not expreſly there, that <hi>the Law requires that we love God with all our Will and Affections and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding?</hi> And ſaies not the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> the ſame, when he bidds us <hi>to glorifie God in our bodies and our ſpirits, which are Gods?</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 20.

               <p>§. 23. But then let me ask further, does <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or any Papiſt elſe, in theſe controverſies aſſert that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement obliges us to that <hi>ſincerity</hi> of Love that is oppoſed to <hi>Partial divided Love,</hi> or Service? Indeed if he had done this, the diſtance between him and the Doctor had not been ſo great as now it is. But then he had withall clearly yielded up the whole cauſe to thoſe he diſputes againſt. And this is it that <hi>Chamier</hi> ſo ſuccesfully preſſes againſt <hi>Bellarmine</hi> from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Fathers,</hi> as ſhall be made good when we come to parallel the Doctors Anſwer with their Expoſition, and that of the moſt reformed Writers.</p>
               <p>§. 24. The truth of it is, that the Doctor is ſo farr from any <hi>compliance</hi> with <hi>Bellarmine</hi> or any other <hi>Popiſh</hi> writer, or from <hi>making uſe in this anſwer of any of their ſhifts in the ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies between us and them</hi> (as the <hi>Refuter</hi> ſadly laies to the Doctors charge) that both <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and the reſt of his party ſpeak of another thing then the Doctor does.

Indeed me thinks it cannot be denyed but that two men may love God with <hi>all their hearts,</hi> and yet one may love him <hi>more</hi> then the other, as is plam from the Parable of the <hi>Talents.</hi> For if <hi>God reward every man according to his works,</hi> plain it is, that he that received the greater Reward and Crown, brought a greater improvement to his Lord, and ſo loved him more, and his Charity and Righteouſneſſe was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then he that received the leſſe Glory, becauſe his improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Righteouſneſſe was leſſe.

               <p>§. 1. The third and fourth charges are, <hi>That theſe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants that have dealt in the Controverſies betwixt us and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts have proved the Doctors ſenſe too narrow. And withall have given an other ſenſe of the words, which they have confirmed and vindicated from the exceptions of the Papiſts; and for this the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of</hi> Chamier <hi>is avouched in the margin,</hi> though the figures of the Chapter be miſtaken.</p>
               <pb n="401" facs="tcp:119243:221"/>
               <p> §. 2. And now for the acquitting the Doctor from theſe <hi>Criminations,</hi> I ſuppoſe it neceſſary (and muſt therefore crave the Reader's patience) to compare the Doctors expoſition with that of the <hi>Prime Reformers,</hi> and thoſe beyond ſuſpicion of any <hi>Popiſh compliance,</hi> eſpecially with that of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine Fathers,</hi> whoſe authority <hi>Chamier</hi> does ſo powerfully preſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in this very Chapter. And if it appear that the Doctor ſpeaks home to them, and is not defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in any thing that <hi>Chamier</hi> does require in that very paſſage our <hi>Refuter</hi> hath quoted in the Margin, I then ſhall hope that he himſelf will acquit the Doctor from this aſperſion, and will be the firſt that ſhall blot it out in a publick <hi>Recantation</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his promiſe.</p>
               <p>§. 3. The Doctors anſwer is, <hi>That Phraſe denoteth two things on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Firſt, ſincerity of this Love of God, as oppoſed to partial divided Love or Service. Secondly, the loving him above all other things, &amp; not admitting any thing into competition with him, not loving any thing elſe in ſuch a degree, and in neither of theſe reſpects excluding all other things from a ſubordinate place in our Love.</hi> To theſe in his Reply to Mr. <hi>Cawdry</hi> he addes for further explication, <hi>that what we do according to the precept of Gods Law, we do out of Love towards God, not hypocritically, or as by conſtraint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 4. That <hi>all theſe</hi> are required by the precept there is no Queſtion, and acknowledged it is by all <hi>Proteſtant Writers</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, for ought I yet can underſtand.

               <p> §. 6. Secondly, when he ſaies <hi>we muſt love God above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, not admitting any thing into competition with him, not loving any thing elſe in ſuch a degree,</hi> this denotes more then <hi>Bellarmine's amor praecipuus</hi> or chief Love, it implies the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi> and <hi>Fervour</hi> and <hi>intenſenſs</hi> of our Love as that is oppoſite to a <hi>remiſneſs</hi> and <hi>lukewarm</hi> affection, which yet <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of as a fulfilling of this Law. And therefore ſaies the learned <hi>Chamier, Concedimus nihil amandum contra Deum, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra Deum, aeque cum Deo: omnia igitur infra Deum, &amp; propter Deum.

               <p>§. 7. And therefore the Doctor ſaies thirdly, <hi>That we muſt love God in ſincerity, as that is oppoſed to partial divided love.</hi> And this makes up all that is or can juſtly be deſired for the full ſenſe and meaning of this Precept. For this <hi>ſincerity</hi> which is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to <hi>partial divided Love</hi> implies, Firſt, that we love God <hi>toti:</hi> for he that loves not God withall his ſoul, his mind and ſtrength, that does not labour to <hi>glorifie God in his body and in</hi>

               <p>Secondly, it implyes that we love God <hi>totum,</hi> that we love e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing in God, and all that belongs to God, that we have a delight, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>to all Gods Commandements;</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 6, 10, 127, 128.</note> we are <hi>partiall</hi> in our Love, and affect him by <hi>halves.</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, it implies that we love God <hi>toto tempore,</hi> that we <hi>conſtantly</hi> and <hi>alwaies</hi> love him; otherwiſe our Love is not <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,</hi> but <hi>broken</hi> and <hi>divided.</hi> And this is that which the Apoſtle calls, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>is the manner how it muſt be done, which by learned men is much dilated: we will reduce them all to three things. We are to do it,</hi> 1. Toti, 2. Totum, 3. Toto tempore, <hi>or</hi> ſemper.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Toti, <hi>as</hi> Jacob <hi>ſaid to</hi> Rachel, <hi>You know that with all my power I have ſerved your Father,</hi> Gen. 31. 6. <hi>and no doubt but he would yeild as much ſervice to God as he did to man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Totum, <hi>with our whole ſoules and bodies we muſt endeavour to keep the whole law: not as</hi> Naaman <hi>did</hi> 2 Kings 5. 18. <hi>keep it by halves; but as</hi> Noah, <hi>who did all that the Lord commanded him about the Ark,</hi> Gen. 6. 22. &amp; 7. 5.</p>

And therefore ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>whether ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, let all things be done to the glory of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 31. We muſt not ſuffer the leaſt <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulet</hi> to be <hi>driven backward</hi> like <hi>Jordan,</hi> or to empt it ſelf, as that does, into a <hi>dead Sea,</hi> but it muſt conſtantly run, and poure <hi>all it's ſtreams</hi> into that boundleſſe <hi>Ocean</hi> of goodneſſe from whence it was derived.</p>
               <p>§. 28. But does not Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſay, <hi>Id ut fiat, anima prius omni alio ſenſu &amp; cogitatione evacuanda?</hi> Yes he does ſo, and ſo does the Doctor. For he that cheriſhes any thought or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that is <hi>oppoſite</hi> and <hi>contrary</hi> to this Love, or admits any thing into <hi>competition</hi> with God, and a <hi>Coordination</hi> in his affection, is not truly ſincere, but is <hi>partial</hi> and <hi>divided</hi> in his Love. But then this is ſo far from excluding all other things from a <hi>ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> place in our Love, that we cannot truly <hi>love God from the heart,</hi> if, according as he commands us, <hi>we do not love our Neighbours as our ſelves.</hi> This preſent ſtate and condition which we now enjoy in the body does require that other things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides God have a place in our affection.

And is not this denyed by <hi>Bellarmine?</hi> and is it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore juſtly charged upon him by Proteſtants?

               </p>
               <p>§. 30.—To this I anſwer by degrees.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that true it is that the learned <hi>Chamier</hi> does thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude againſt <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> But then plain it is, that theſe are none of that <hi>Veterum Sententia quam nos tenemus,</hi> but only In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and Deductions from it. And if our <hi>Refuter</hi> will allow me, what he cannot reaſonably deny, that the Doctors expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is exactly conformable to this of the Ancients, which <hi>Chamier</hi> acknowledges that the Proteſtants maintain, I ſhall not envy him thoſe advantages he can make by theſe Corollaries.</p>
               <p>§. 31. Secondly, though it were <note n="†" place="margin">

               <p>§. 32. Thirdly, I acknowledge that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> grants that Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Bernard</hi> and <hi>Aquinas</hi> and other of the old Schoolmen do ſpeak of ſuch a Perfection required by this Law, that advances our Love to that height, that we muſt do nothing elſe but think of God, nothing elſe but love him, and this not only in the Habit, but in the Act. This Love he acknowledges does ſo wholly poſſeſs the ſoul, that no idle vitious Thought
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:119243:231"/> can obtrude or preſs in upon it, nothing either contrary or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this holy love can have any the leaſt admiſſion into the heart, but that of neceſſity God is, and muſt be all in all. But then he addes that this Love is proper only to the Saints in Bliſs, and that we whilſt we are in the fleſh, as we are not capable of it, ſo it is not, it cannot be enjoyned us, but it is only propoſed that we may know what we are to aim at, and hope for, and deſire in heaven, and that this is the meaning of Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> &amp; <hi>Bernard</hi> and <hi>Aquinas</hi> and the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> when they ſay this Perfection is not attainable in this life. But of this more in due place, and let <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſtand and fall to his own Maſter.</p>
               <p>§. 33. But then Fourthly, be it granted that thoſe Corollaries of <hi>Chamier</hi> are rightly inferred againſt <hi>Bellarmine's</hi> doctrine of the ſeveral ſtates of Perfection, and works of ſupererogation, and the poſſibility of fulfilling the Law; yet neither of them will any whit advantage our <hi>Refuter</hi> in the preſent controverſie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending between him and the Doctor. For though God ſhould require of us by that Law that we love him <hi>totis viribus naturae, &amp; non tantum totis viribus corruptionis;</hi> yet the <note n="†" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>§. 35. It is true that for a <hi>Salve</hi> he ſaies, that <hi>Chriſt was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Law.</hi>

               <p> §. 36. But then this is nothing to the purpoſe.

               </p>
               <p>§. 37. If here it be replyed, that as Chriſt according to his <hi>Divine Nature</hi> was <hi>above</hi> the <hi>Law,</hi> ſo by virtue of the <hi>Hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> as <hi>Man</hi> he had the <hi>fulneſs</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> which <hi>Adam</hi> had not, whereby he was enabled to ſuch <hi>ſupererogating Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 38. For anſwer, indeed I grant that he had the very <note n="†" place="margin">John 1. 16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. 34. Coloſſ. 1. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Grace.</hi> But then this ſolves not the Doubt.

And in this reſpect the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> are equall, becauſe both as <hi>Men</hi> were <hi>equally made under the Law.</hi> But then <hi>Adam,</hi> though he were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a <hi>mutable Condition,</hi> as <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not, though he had not a <hi>fulneſſe of Grace,</hi> as <hi>Chriſt,</hi> had, yet if he had not fallen from his firſt innocence, he had ſuch a <hi>Meaſure</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Original Righteouſneſſe</hi> beſtowed upon him, that would not only have preſerved him in his integrity, but alſo enabled him to do whatſoever the <hi>Law</hi> required, and whatſoever other vertuous,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:119243:232"/> holy, pious performances could by <hi>Man,</hi> a <hi>debtor</hi> to the <hi>Law,</hi> be done above it. And if any man ſhall aſſert the contrary, I deſire either his Reaſon or Scripture to make it good.</p>
               <p>§. 39. And then ſecondly, as to the Perfection of the Love of the bleſſed <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> in Heaven, it is eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable (and the Doctor has in part done it in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of <hi>Will-worſhip)</hi> that though they all love God Natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Neceſſarily, and <hi>ad ultimum virium,</hi> yet they do not all love God in the ſame indiviſible degree of Perfection and Point of fervour and intenſeneſſe, which (to uſe the Doctors <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Ham.</hi> Treat. of Will-worſhip, ſect. 49. p. 101. edit.

All the Stars of the firmament are full of the Suns light: yet all are not of the ſame brightneſſe and luſtre, becauſe they are not of the ſame Magnitude. We ſee <hi>there is one glory of the Sun, another of the Moon, and another glory of the Stars: For one Star differeth from another Star in glory.</hi> And yet the Sun, the Fountain of light, does equally ſhine on all. This gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual difference in their luſtre and brightneſſe ariſes from their different Capacities. If all were of an equal Bigneſſe and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:119243:233"/> and Diſtance from the Sun, their ſight would be the ſame. The <hi>Eſſence</hi> &amp; the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Fire</hi> is as truly in the weak &amp; <hi>lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent flames</hi> of ſpirit of Wine or Straw, as in red hot Iron, or moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Braſs, or <hi>Nebuchadnezars</hi> fiery fornace; and yet they do not heat and flame and ſcorch alike. This difference does a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the variety of the Combuſtible matter now enkindled. For though Natural agents do alwayes work uniformly, becauſe they work neceſſarily and to the utmoſt of their power: yet the intenſeneſs of their operations is alwaies proportioned to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and efficacy and virtue of the Cauſes from whence they do flow. Otherwiſe the light of a <hi>Candle</hi> would be equal to the brightneſs of the <hi>Sun,</hi> which yet we ſee is loſt and ſwallowed up by the Sun-beams. And therefore Mr. <hi>Cawdrey,</hi> as we have already obſerved, without ſcruple grants to the Doctor that <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Love is capable of Degrees, whether in the ſame man at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, or two men at the ſame time, and ſo both may obey the precept;</hi> though yet with <hi>Chamier</hi> he maintains that the utmoſt height and Point of Perfection poſſible is required, and that whatſoever is ſhort of that <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>§. 42. For whereas Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> in his <hi>Triplex Diatribe</hi> had ſaid, <hi>that every man is bound to be prudent to that degree of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which</hi> Adam <hi>loſt by ſin;</hi> the Doctor makes anſwer, <hi>That if by ſin he means not actual, but original ſin, and ſo thinks that every man is bound to be prudent to that degree of Prudence that</hi> Adam <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſt by his fall, this ſure will be found a miſtake. For this loſs of</hi> Adam's <hi>was a puniſhment of</hi> Adam's <hi>ſin, and when it is inflicted by God on his poſterity, muſt be looked on as a puniſhment, and he that is puniſhed cannot be obliged not to be puniſhed No man is now obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be as prudent as</hi> Adam <hi>was in his integrity any more then to be as healthy, in effect to be immortal. Nay, ſuppoſing</hi> Adam <hi>to have ſinned, and ſo to have tranſgreſſed the Law in that, it cannot be imagined that it is over and above that a new or further Act of ſin in him to be leſs knowing, prudent or healthy then he was: all theſe without any new act of his will, nay contrary thereto, falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him by God's Decree or punitive Juſtice. And if it were not ſin in</hi> Adam <hi>himſelf, then ſure it cannot be ſuch in his Poſterity; and ſo a man now of his poſterity cannot be bound to that degree of Prudence which</hi> Adam <hi>once had, any more then to be born in the ſtate of Innocence and Perfection, when yet he is neceſſarily ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be born after the image of the lapſed imperfect</hi> Adam, <hi>which he</hi>

               </p>
               <p>§. 43. And then ſecondly, whereas Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> in the ſame place added, that <hi>every man is bound to be pious in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, becauſe the law requires Perfection of holineſs, and in another place, becauſe the Law requires perfect Obedience of Chriſtians, as the Rule of eternal righteouſneſs;</hi> to this the Doctor makes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thus: <hi>The Law indeed ſometimes ſignifies the Covenant of</hi>
                  <pb n="427" facs="tcp:119243:234"/> 
                  <hi>exact unſinning Obedience. And of that Law, or that Covenant it is moſt true that it required perfect, as that ſignifies unſinning, Obedience. But then, firſt, This was the firſt Covenant, and is not now in force with faithful penitent Chriſtians, who are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Law, but under Grace,</hi> i. e. <hi>under a</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                  <hi>Covenant, which requires not Innocence but Repentance, ſincere, but not perfect O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. And therefore</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, <hi>It cannot truly be ſaid, that this Law requires this Perfect Obedience of Chriſtians, nor conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it is the rule of Evangelical righteouſneſs,</hi> i. e. <hi>of that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs by which believers are now ſaid to be juſtifyed: for that</hi> (as he had more fully explained in the <hi>Practical Catechiſm)</hi> is <note place="margin">Pract.

In a word, the condition required of us is a Conſtellation or conjuncture of all thoſe Goſpel Graces, Faith, Hope, Charity, Self-denyal, Repentance and the reſt, every one of them truly and ſincerely rooted in the Chriſtian heart, though mixed with much weakneſs and imperfection, and perhaps with many ſins, ſo they be not wilfully and impenitently lived and dyed in; for in that caſe nothing but perdition is to be expected.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 44. And as this is the Doctors opinion of the Condition of the ſecond Covenant, and the Sincerity of Holineſs required by it; ſo he maintains, and has fully made it good, that neither the <hi>Legal</hi> nor <hi>Evangelical</hi> Purity, not that Perfection of holineſs which conſiſted in <hi>unſinning</hi> obedience, nor that which requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſincere and <hi>upright conformity</hi> to Gods lawes, did include the <hi>higheſt</hi> degree of Piety which is poſſible, but had a latitude, and conſiſted of Degrees; both ſtates being ſtates of <hi>proficiency</hi> and growth, and conteining in their compaſs and extent ſeveral <note n="*" place="margin">

This the Doctor has at large proved and explained beyond all the exceptions of Mr. <hi>Cawdrey.</hi> The places are too many to be tranſcribed, and therefore I muſt refer the Reader for further ſatisfaction to that accurate Treatiſe of the Doctors, being a full <hi>Account</hi> of Mr. <hi>Cawdrey's Triplex Diatribe,</hi> particularly to the 6. chapter of that Treatiſe ſect. 8. Indeed the whole Vindication of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Will-worſhip, is chiefly ſpent upon this Argument. And I was the more willing upon this occaſion to repreſent the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors opinion in this point the more largely, that our Refuter might have occaſion <hi>ex profeſſo</hi> to undertake and to make his experiment, whether he can more ſuccesfully manage it againſt the Doctor then Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> did or can.</p>
               <p>§. 45. And now to acquit the Doctor from <hi>Singularity</hi> and the aſperſion of <hi>Popery</hi> in this Point, I ſhall crave leave of the Readers patience to inſtance in two, and but two, very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Proteſtants (for I am quite tired with this dull work of quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, though it cannot poſſibly be declined in this manner of diſpute) that are of the ſame opinion with the Doctor, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with him from <hi>Chamier</hi> and our <hi>Refuter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 46. The firſt is that Reverend and learned Author of the <hi>Additions</hi> annexed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the <hi>Pattern of Catechiſtical doctrine</hi> at large.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But againſt this</hi> (that God gave us ability at the firſt to do
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:119243:235"/> what he commanded, but we having loſt that ability vainly, God may lawfully exact of us, what he ſet us to do) <hi>ſome object, that ſeeing man loſt this ability not</hi> efficienter, <hi>but</hi> meritoriè, <hi>God's penal Act depriving him of it, it can no more ſtand with God's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Wiſdom ſtill to require the ſame obedience without new abilities, then for a Magiſtrate having cut of a mans feet for ſome offence, yet to require him to go to ſuch a place, and then to puniſh him for not going: and therefore it may be ſaid, that God never requires any thing of us, but he either gives or is ready to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to do it, if we be not wanting to our ſelves. And therefore as God requires Obedience under the Goſpel, ſo he enables us by his Grace, or is ready to enable, if we ſeek to him to do what he requires: as to avoid every known and wilfull ſin, and ſo perform the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of every good duty; though we are ſtill ſubject to ſins of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, which we muſt labour againſt, and though we come ſhort of Perfection in ſome degree, yet we muſt aim at it, and not reſt in a Perfection of parts. Thus every Chriſtian may and ought to keep the Law of God, as it is qualified and moderated in the Goſpel, ſo as to be free from all reigning ſin, and to perform every Act com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in ſincerity: and as this is poſſible by the grace of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſo it is neceſſary to ſalvation in all after their Converſion and Repentance. As for that abſolute Perfection or freedom from all ſin, it is commanded too, but not as actually neceſſary to ſalvation, but only in our true and conſtant endeavour as that which we muſt aim at, and come as near to as we can, though we do not attain it in this life. And thus it may be truly ſaid, that the Law, though it cannot be kept in that abſolute and exact manner which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the Covenant of works, that is without the leaſt omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or intermiſſion, in which ſenſe God does not now require it of us to ſalvation, yet as it is required in the ſecond Covenant according to the equity and moderation of the Goſpel, it may by the grace of Chriſt be kept, and muſt be kept by every true Chriſtian, ſo far as God requires it of us now. And this is the Chriſtian perfection which the Scripture often exhorts to, and the Catholick Church of Chriſt ever acknowledged. God having made a ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, wherein there is a Law to be kept, as well as promiſes to be believed, requires Obedience now not by virtue of the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which is void, but according to the ſecond, which is ſtill in</hi>

               <p>§. 50. With what colour of truth then can it be maintained that <hi>it muſt be deputed and reckoned my ſin, if I love not God to as high a degree in this life as is poſſible to be attained in the next?</hi> For does not that height and perfection of Love depend purely upon the ſight and enjoyment of God, and the participation of Heaven happineſs? And is not this height and intenſeneſſe of Love an effect at leaſt of the happineſs of <hi>the Spirits of juſt men made perfect?</hi> And does not this wholly and abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon Gods bounty?

Thus therefore I ſhould, with our <hi>Refuters</hi> leave, chuſe to underſtand the words, though I muſt confeſſe with a little ſtreining, becauſe thus underſtood they are more agreeable to truth, and other Proteſtant Writers, and his own more ſober expreſſions, and the whole ſcope of that Chapter; namely, That all the degrees of Love to the utmoſt height that are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly attainable either in this life or the next, are in that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement either propoſed to our Endeavours, or our Hopes and our Aimes, and it is purely through our own fault if we do not attain unto it.

               <p>§. 54. But then plain it is that thoſe words, conſtrued in the ſenſe I have given of them, do no whit favour that opinion. Yet be this as it will, and let our <hi>Refuter</hi> make what uſe he can of them: Sufficient it will be to the Doctors Vindication, if the ſame learned <hi>Chamier</hi> ſpeaks to the Doctors purpoſe in his Recapitulation and ſummary of all that he had formerly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. And it is that very place which our <hi>Refuter</hi> has in his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin quoted againſt the Doctor. The words are theſe.</p>

That is, <hi>The matter at length comes to this,</hi> or <hi>this is the ſhort and ſumm of all, That we know and take notice that the Love of God is ſo injoyned and required of us by this Precept, that there can be no one degree of Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the higheſt, with which any man may lawfully ſit down and reſt contented as a fulfilling of the Command. The higheſt, I ſay, not only in reſpect of all other things that fall under our Love, and within the compaſſe of our affection, but alſo and more eſpecially in regard of our ſelves, ſo that we cannot poſſibly love more or go beyond it in our affection. For then and ſo only will truly the whole heart, the whole Soul, the whole mind and all our ſtength be placed upon this Love, which yet ſhall not fully be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in this life, ſo long as any motion of ſinful luſts and concupiſcence reignes and flouriſhes or ſprings up in us. And this is that which</hi> Auſtin <hi>hath alſo ſaid, and</hi> Bellarmine <hi>cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to have been affirmed and maintained by the</hi> Fathers.</p>
               <p>§. 55. From whence plain it is.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that <hi>Chamier</hi> in this place againſt <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpeaks of an abſolute ſinleſſe Perfection, and an exact conformity to the whole Law of God, not attainable in this life, which no whit concernes the Doctor, that ſpeaks not at all of that, but only of the ſincerity of this or that vertue or grace in reſpect of this or that Performance, which he ſaies conſiſts in a latitude, and has Degrees.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that though this ſinleſs Perfection be not attaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this life, yet labour we muſt after it as much as in us lies, there being no one degree of Charity or divine Love below this, wherein a man may acquieſce, ſo that he may ceaſe to <hi>grow in grace and the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> which was
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:119243:239"/> the <hi>Hereſie</hi> of the <hi>Perfectiſts</hi> condemned in the Council of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that by the higheſt degree <hi>Chamier</hi> means, not that which is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>ſimply</hi> ſuch, as if there were, as <note n="*" place="margin">We ſay that there are degrees of, or rather to perfection here, upon condition that every degree, even the higheſt, is required by the Law of God, and what is ſhort of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt is ſo far culpable. <hi>Cawdrey Triplex Diatribe, p.</hi> 110.</note> Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> would have it, one indiviſible point of Love and height of Perfection to which all muſt arrive that obey the Precept; but only <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that which is <hi>reſpectively</hi> and in ſome ſort the higheſt, not ſo much in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of other things beloved by us, as in regard of our own ſtrength and vigour, ſo that we can not love beyond it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that then we ſhall truly love God with all the heart, when we ſhall do nothing elſe but love him, and perfectly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his Lawes; which will not, cannot be ſo long as any motion of evil concupiſcence dwells in us, which will be ſo long as we are in the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, that his Opinion in this Point is the ſame with St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> and the ancient <hi>Fathers;</hi> and this is all he undertakes to make good againſt <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 56. And therefore if it appear (as I doubt not but it will anon) that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Bernard, Aquinas</hi> and the old <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> were of opinion, that this abſolute, ſinleſs <hi>perfection,</hi> and uninterrupted <hi>actual Love</hi> of God, was not attainable in this life, and therefore could not be obligatory to believers <hi>ſub periculo animae</hi> to attain it, but was only ſo far commanded as that we ſhould <hi>aſpire</hi> to it, only ſo far propoſed as the <hi>Object</hi> of our <hi>hopes</hi> and <hi>aimes</hi> and <hi>endeavours,</hi> and that we ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as much as in us lies to come up to the Perfection of Saints, (it being the prime Jewel, the brighteſt <hi>aureola</hi> and glory of their Crown of happineſſe) that we ſhould earneſtly long for our <hi>tranſlation,</hi> and deſire a better life <hi>wherein dwells righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> that upon conſideration of it we ſhould be humbled in our Pride &amp; empty conceipts of <hi>Perfection,</hi> and be admoniſhed of our Frailty and infirmity, and that we ſhould be inſtructed that by <hi>the works of the Law no fleſh living can be juſtified,</hi> and that
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:119243:239"/> therefore we have all reaſon to rejoice that <hi>now we are not under the Law</hi> (which requires exact unſinning obedience) <hi>but Grace,</hi> and the ſecond Covenant (which requires Faith and Repentance, and our utmoſt and moſt ſincere and hearty En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to <hi>ſerve</hi> God, <hi>in holineſs and righteouſneſſe</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to all his Commandements <hi>all the dayes of our lives)</hi> it will evidently follow that <hi>Chamier</hi> alſo meant the ſame. And then there will be a perfect harmony and agreement between him and the Doctor, whatſoever becomes of <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 57. And now let me deſire our <hi>Refuter</hi> to review this <hi>Reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation</hi> and Summary of <hi>Chamier's</hi> opinion in this point, and let him tell me if it be not the very ſame with that of <hi>Grotius?</hi> Let him conſider, and deal impartially, and ſay whether it be not all one in ſubſtance with that of the learned Author of the <hi>Additions</hi> to the Reverend Biſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> his <hi>Pattern of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſtical Doctrin.</hi> Let him tell me whether there be any thing in this Opinion of <hi>Chamier</hi> that is not to be found in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor. For does he not expreſly ſay that <hi>we muſt love God above all things, and as much as poſſibly we can?</hi> that we muſt not <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in any one degree of holineſs,</hi> but that we muſt grow in grace till we come to be perfect men in Chriſt Jeſus, and ſtill im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our Talents till we be called to our Audit? does he not ſay that <hi>though exact unſinning obedience,</hi> this abſolute perfection, <hi>be not attainable in this</hi> life; yet <hi>renewed, ſincere, honeſt, faithful obedience is required to the whole Goſpel; that we give up the whole heart to Chriſt, and ſincerely labour to mortifie every luſt, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form uniform obedience to God, ſtill bewayling our infirmities and ſins, and from every fall riſing again by Repentance</hi> and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation? Saies he not in effect all along, that though Believers are not bound <hi>ſub periculo animae</hi> to attain to exact unſinning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience (that being the Condition only of the firſt Covenant, and not at all concerning us now to <hi>Juſtification,</hi> becauſe <hi>we are not under the Law, but under Grace;)</hi> yet by the Tenour of the ſecond Covenant we muſt <hi>aſpire</hi> to it, and <hi>endeavour</hi> after it as much as we can, becauſe the Tenour of the <hi>ſecond Covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires our utmoſt endevours to obey God in all his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; to love him with the whole heart, and will, and affections,</hi>
                  <pb n="438" facs="tcp:119243:240"/> 
                  <hi>and underſtanding, to improve our Talents to the utmoſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;</hi> and that the more God enables us by his Grace, the more we ſhould labour to love him; and that <hi>having theſe promiſes we ſhould cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs both of fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of the Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 58. Nay ſaies he not expreſſy and in termes terminant, as they ſpeak in the Schooles, <hi>That Piety is one of thoſe vertues—which</hi>

When you glorifie the Lord, exalt him as much as you can, for even he yet will far exceed; and when you exalt him, put forth all your ſtrength, for you can never go far enough. i. e. <hi>How far ſo ever you exceed the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Command, you are yet within the compaſs of the general</hi> (this general command of Love, on which hang all the Law and the Prophets) <hi>and in reſpect of that, can never be thought to have done enough, though the particular Act or Degree of it be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that you are not particularly obliged to?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 59. And now if this come not home to that expoſition of <hi>Chamier</hi> which our <hi>Refuter</hi> has quoted in the Margin; I ſhall never expect to find a Parallel, or that the Print and the Seal, the Face and the Shape and Reflexion in the Glaſs ſhould ever agree and be alike. And therefore if after a ſecond review of this his Charge he ſhall not find any the leaſt paſſage in that quotation rightly underſtood, that I ſhall not alſo parallel in Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> and thoſe of his Opinion, I ſhall in Juſtice expect that he ſhould blot out this Calumny alſo, and ſay that he was miſtaken in the Doctors opinion, and acknowledge that it is the very ſame with <hi>Chamier's,</hi> and of all other Proteſtants that underſtand what they ſay, and are willing to ſay no more againſt Papiſts then they are able to maintain. For as for his friend Mr. <hi>Cawdrey's</hi> Addition to this expoſition, it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Doctors anſwer that he is not able to make it good; and I doubt not but our <hi>Refuter</hi> will be found as weak as he, in his defence of a known untruth, which admits of no rational <hi>Medium</hi> to make it good.</p>

               <p> §. 60.

               </p>

               <p>Saies he not again, <hi>Every man is bound to be merciful to his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as our heavenly Father is merciful</hi> (which ſure is the higheſt degree) <hi>though every man be not bound to the ſame degree of mercy with other men, becauſe every man hath not either the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of abilities, or the ſame opportunities?</hi> Ibid. p. 104.</p>
               <p>Sayes he not again, <hi>Now to undertake the way of perfection in holineſs cannot be dangerous to any, but is the duty of all, and every man may receive it that in Sincerity looks after it, at leaſt to acceptation?</hi> Ibid. p. 108.</p>
               <p>Sayes he not again, <hi>Who knows not that if there be a willing mind, it is accepted according to what a man hath, not according to what a man hath not? And his reward (for ought we know) may be accordingly equal with thoſe that have more abilities and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of doing good or ſuffering ill for Chriſt. Any men, all men are alwaies bound to aſpire to the perfection of Holineſs, not to the perfection of Martyrdome?</hi> Ibid. p. 109.</p>
               <p>Sayes he not again, <hi>But then thirdly, the Perfection we are commanded by Chriſt to aſpire to is capable of Degrees, &amp;c. we ſhall grant him this &amp;c.—For we ſay there are degrees of, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to perfection here?</hi> Ibid. p. 110.</p>
               <p>Saies he not again, <hi>If by Repentance, Faith, and Love, we ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely endeavour after perfection, Firſt our failings ſhall be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and our weak works accepted through Chriſt our Mediator?</hi> Ibid. p. 113.</p>

               <p>§. 63. If now our <hi>Refuter</hi> ſhall ſay that it is true Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> ſaies all this, but then he addes all along, that <hi>the higheſt degree of Perfection is alſo commanded;</hi> that <hi>nothing of goodneſs nor any</hi>

               <p>§. 64. To this I anſwer;</p>
               <p>That it is very true indeed that he ſaies this and more in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to <hi>Truth</hi> as well as Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> nor could his cauſe have been maintained with any Colour but by ſuch aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

               <p>§. 66. If our <hi>Refuter</hi> can now find a <hi>ſalve</hi> for theſe <hi>ſores,</hi> I ſhall think him an admirable <hi>Chyrurgion;</hi> but then withall I muſt accuſe him for his skill, and ſay he is <hi>Popiſhly affected,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he undertakes to make <hi>good</hi> contradictions, and maintain they may <hi>both</hi> be <hi>true,</hi> and yet be <hi>contradictory.</hi> So eaſie it is for men that are over-curious to ſpy faults in a Brother's eye, not to ſee the greateſt beam in their own; and they that are moſt guilty of <note n="*" place="margin">This I can ſay, he ſpeaks Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection admits of no degrees or growth, but rather degrees and growth in Grace (which are oft command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) argue there is no perfection in this life. <hi>Cawdrey's Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex Diatrib.</hi> p. 110.</note> Contradictions themſelves, do firſt find fault with it in others; and men in oppoſition to a <hi>Perſon</hi> and a <hi>Cauſe</hi> they have once without <hi>reaſon</hi> or for <hi>intereſt</hi> diſliked, may be drawn in that heat and zeal of contradiction to fight againſt <hi>truth</hi> it ſelf for the <hi>Perſons</hi> ſake that maintaines it.

               <p>§. 67. If now our Refuter ſhall, <hi>Antaeus</hi> like, recover
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:119243:242"/> breath and ſtrength by this fall, and ſay, that if the Doctor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that we are bound to love God with all the heart, and to obey him ſincerely in all commands, then conſequently in this, and then there will be nothing that will be left to our freedom and choice:</p>
               <p>§. 58. To this I anſwer,</p>
               <p>Firſt, that this Objection as equally concerns himſelf and his Friends as it does the Doctor For firſt, it is moſt true that there were certain <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the LXXII. renders it Free-will offerings under the Law, that were a part of the <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> and <hi>ſervice</hi> of God when they were performed, which yet were not particularly enjoined by any <hi>particular precept</hi> or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God's in the Law, but were left to every mans <hi>liberty</hi> to offer or not to offer them, but yet were accepted by God if they were heartily performed. And Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> acknowledges that the <hi>Jew</hi> under the <hi>Moſaical</hi> diſpenſation had not only <hi>libertatem ſpecificationis,</hi> a liberty to make choice of what he would offer, but alſo <hi>libertatem exercitii,</hi> a liberty to offer or not offer them, when it was (to uſe his own words) <hi>left free in ſome caſes for a man to offer or not to offer beyond what was poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required by the Law.</hi> If thou wilt offer a free-will offering, a <hi>Nidabah,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And herein only or chiefly ſtands the formality of a Free-will offering, as contradiſtinguiſhed to thoſe offerings which were commanded by the Law, &amp;c.</hi> Triplex Diatr. p. 88, 91.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, to <hi>David's</hi> Voluntary Reſolution of building the Temple, the ſame Mr. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> replyes, that <hi>this was in the time of the Law or before Chriſt, but the time of the Goſpel gives no ſuch allowance. Free-will offerings were then allowed. And for this anſwer he quotes</hi> Chamier, <hi>tom.</hi> 3. <hi>l</hi> 20. <hi>c.</hi> 5. §. 25. <hi>p.</hi> 754. Chemnit. <hi>in Exod.</hi> and ſaies moreover, that <hi>Divines reſolve there be now no free-will offerings under the Goſpel, though under the Law there were, becauſe the worſhip then is far different from the worſhip now.</hi> Triplex Diatribe p. 95, 96. How truly this is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted it concernes not me at preſent to enquire, and therefore I ſhall refer the Reader to the Doctors <hi>Account</hi> of this <hi>Triplex Diatribe,</hi> c. 6. ſect. 1, 2, &amp;c. Sufficient it is that both he and
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:119243:242"/> 
                  <hi>Chamier</hi> allow Free-will offerings and uncommanded Acts of Worſhip under the Law. And therefore I infer, that this Law of loving God with all the heart notwithſtanding, there are yet ſome Acts of Worſhip that were left to mans <hi>liberty</hi> to perform: if he offered them he did well, and it was accepted by God; and if he did not, he tranſgreſſed no <hi>particular</hi> command, nay ſinned not againſt that firſt great Law of Love. For as plain it is, that this Law was in force even under the <hi>Moſaical</hi> diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, when yet as plain it is, that the Free-will offerings were allowed. <hi>What is written in the Law</hi> (ſayes our Saviour to the Lawyer?) <hi>how readeſt thou? And he anſwering ſaid,</hi> Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, &amp;c. <hi>And he ſaid unto him, thou haſt anſwered right,</hi> Luke 10. 26, 27, 28. And in another place he reſolves that <hi>this is the firſt and great Commandement in the Law,</hi> and that <hi>on this, and the ſecond like unto it, hang all the Law and the Prophets,</hi> Matth. 22. 38, 39, 40.</p>
               <p>§. 69. And now whatſoever anſwer our <hi>Refuter</hi> ſhall be able to make to reconcile and ſolve this <hi>allowance</hi> with that <hi>Precept,</hi> will alſo equally ſerve the Doctors intereſt and aſſertion; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plain that when this Law was in force, there were uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded acts of Piety and Religion, which no man ſinned by omitting, but were left free to the liberty and choice of him that ſhould perform them.</p>
               <p>§. 70. Secondly, I anſwer from the Doctor, that theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commanded degrees or acts of Devotion, though they are not enjoyned or impoſed upon any man by any <hi>particular</hi> Law and Precept <hi>ſub periculo animae,</hi> and in this reſpect are left to our freedom to do or not to do them, yet they are within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of the <hi>general</hi> command of Love, <hi>and in reſpect of that, when a man has done all he can, he can never be thought to have done enough, though the particular Act or the degree of it be ſomewhat that he is not particularly obliged to.</hi> Treat. of. Will-worſhip, ſect. 17.</p>
               <p>§. 71. Thirdly, I anſwer from the Doctor, that this is an
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:119243:243"/> 
                  <hi>affirmative Precept,</hi> of which according to the Obſervation of the Schools, the rule is true that <hi>obligant ſemper, ſed non ad ſemper,</hi> they <hi>oblige us alwaies, yet do not oblige us to be alwaies exerciſing ſome one act of the vertues ſo commanded;</hi> and ſo though a man be alwaies bound to love God to the utmoſt height he can, in regard of the habit, yet there may be a liberty and freedom in the exerciſe, not only to this or that particular Act, but alſo to this or that degree, not under any <hi>particular</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and yet the <hi>general</hi> Law may at the ſame inſtant be fully ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>§. 72. Fourthly, I anſwer, that this <note n="*" place="margin">Matt. 22. 38.</note> firſt and great Commandement, and the ſecond like unto it, are <note n="†" place="margin">This is the firſt and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement] It was none of the ten Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements in particular, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines all the Commandements of the firſt Table; and therefore is counted the greateſt. Verſ. 39. Is like unto it] Not equal to it, duty to God is above du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to man, but like it in greatneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it containeth all the duties of the ſecond table as the other did of the firſt, Verſ. 40. And the Prophets] This is the contents and ſum of them all. Aſſembly Notes on Matt. 22. 38, 39, 40.</note> 
                  <hi>General precepts</hi> on which <hi>hang all the Law and the Prophets,</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel duties too.</hi> And therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive that they ſhould infer any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ſpecial</hi> obligation then what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the <hi>ſpecial laws,</hi> into which they are particularly branched and ſpread. Hence it is that our Saviour ſayes to his Diſciples, <note n="*" place="margin">John 14. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>if you love me keep my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi> And the Apoſtle in another place, Rom. 13. 8, 9, 10. <hi>He that loveth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother hath fulfilled the Law. For this, Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery, thou ſhalt not Kill, Thou ſhalt not ſteal, Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſſe, Thou ſhalt not covet, and if there be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commandement, it is briefly comprehended in this ſaying, namely, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf. Love work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth none ill to his Neighbour; therefore Love is the fulfilling of the Law. For all the Law,</hi> as the ſame Apoſtle Gal. 5. 14. <hi>is fulfilled in this one word, even in this, Thou ſhalt love thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelf.</hi> Theſe therefore being <hi>general</hi> Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, muſt be ſuppoſed, as all other <hi>generals</hi> are, to be fully contained in the ſeveral <hi>Particulars</hi> that are comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them. And therefore if it appear that there be certain <hi>Acts</hi> or <hi>degrees</hi> of Piety that are not commanded by any <hi>particular</hi>
                  <pb n="445" facs="tcp:119243:243"/> Law <hi>ſuo periculo animae,</hi> but are left free to our <hi>liberty</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form or not perform them, they cannot be ſuppoſed to be commanded by the <hi>general,</hi> ſo that the man ſhould <hi>ſin</hi> that does not perform them. For that would infer a contradiction, that they ſhould be left at <hi>liberty,</hi> and yet at the ſame time they ſhould be <hi>commanded;</hi> that it ſhould be lawful for me to do or not to do them, and yet at the ſame inſtant I ſhould ſin, and ſo endanger my own ſoul, if yet I did not perform them. And if any man at any time ſhould be obliged to perform them <hi>ſub periculo animae</hi> by vertue of this general Law, then all men, at the ſame inſtant muſt be obliged under the ſame danger to do it, becauſe all men by vertue of this Law, are bound to love God <hi>alike,</hi> becauſe <hi>with all their heart and mind and ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>their neighbours as themſelves;</hi> and then the Law, which is the rule of Righteouſneſs, would be a rule and a cauſe of tranſgreſſion, and I muſt of neceſſity ſin, whatſoever I did. Adde to this, that if any <hi>ſpecial</hi> obligation not contained in any <hi>particular</hi> law were over and above contained in theſe two <hi>generals,</hi> then ſomething that is not in the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> and <hi>Evangelical</hi> precepts muſt be contained in it, and then the <hi>Generals</hi> would be larger then all the <hi>Particulars coll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ectively</hi> taken; and then our Saviour had not given us a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Account of the latitude and extent of theſe precepts, when he ſaid they were the <hi>great commandements on which hang all the Law and the Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 73. And therefore though it may be granted, that if there are uncommanded Acts and Degrees of devotion (as it is plain there were under the <hi>Law</hi> by the <hi>Free-will offerings,</hi> and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor has abundantly proved it that there are ſo alſo under the <hi>Goſpel)</hi> they all come under the <hi>general</hi> command for <hi>allowance</hi> and approbation, as proceeding out of a pious affection of Love and gratitude to God, in which regard it is impoſſible to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the latitude of the Command; yet I cannot ſee how they can ſo come within the compaſs of this general Law, that they ſhould induce a <hi>particular obligation,</hi> and make the man guilty of tranſgreſſion that does not perform what he is not in <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> commanded.</p>
               <pb n="446" facs="tcp:119243:244"/>
               <p> §. 74. Though then when they are done they may be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, becauſe when they are <hi>freely</hi> performed they are fruits and arguments of our Love, that is enjoyned by that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement; yet for all that, the Omiſſion of them cannot make us guilty of our breach of a <hi>precept,</hi> or neglect of a <hi>duty,</hi> ſince whatſoever is of this nature is contained in ſome <hi>particular law</hi> that particularly enjoynes it. And therefore</p>
               <p>§. 75. Fifthly, I diſtinguiſh of <hi>the love of God;</hi> It is often taken (as we have formerly demonſtrated from the Scriptures) in <hi>general,</hi> for the affection of <hi>Piety,</hi> or <hi>Charity,</hi> and often more <hi>ſtrictly</hi> and <hi>properly,</hi> for that high, that tranſcendent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that is <hi>immediately</hi> fixed on God himſelf. The Acts of this are <hi>elicite</hi> Acts, and <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> Acts of Love; the other are <hi>imperate</hi> Acts, and <hi>effectively,</hi> and <hi>demonſtratively</hi>

Now then, though in reſpect of the <hi>formal</hi> and <hi>elicite</hi> Acts of Love, there can be no Act nor degree that is left to our <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>choyce,</hi> but all things are here in the utmoſt height commanded that we can poſſible perform, and this by virtue of <note place="margin">

                  </note> this firſt great fundamental Law, as alſo by the <hi>obligation of gratitude, and congruence</hi> (to uſe our Refuters words) <hi>he being infinitely good in himſelf, and we alſo owing to him</hi> omne quod ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus &amp; omne quod poſſumus, <hi>whatſoever we are and whatſoever we can do;</hi> yet in reſpect of the <hi>imperate</hi> Acts of Love, that are the fruits and ſignes of the former, there may be <hi>uncommanded</hi> Acts and Degrees, which though they are <hi>approved</hi> when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, becauſe they are conformable to this firſt great Law, and are the iſſues and demonſtrations of that Love there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, yet are they not commanded by this or any other <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> law <hi>ſub periculo animae,</hi> but are left by God to our <hi>liberty</hi>

               <p>§. 76. And therefore though every man be bound to love God as much as he is able, and to <hi>expreſſe</hi> his love in that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and manner that he has preſcribed in his <hi>particular</hi> laws to that purpoſe; yet this nothing hinders but that he may la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to <hi>expreſſe</hi> that Love in ſome Acts and ſome Degrees that God has not <hi>particularly</hi> enjoyned, ſo long as they be within the compaſs of his <hi>general approbation</hi> and <hi>promiſe</hi> of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And therefore though it be lawfull for every man to expreſſe his love as much as he can, though it be in Acts of Piety and Charity or degrees of them not particularly commanded; yet it will not therefore follow, that becauſe I am bound to love God as much as I can by this Law, therefore I am bound to <hi>expreſſe</hi> this my Love in this or that <hi>particular degree</hi> or <hi>Act</hi> of Piety and Charity not particularly commanded. And therefore notwithſtanding this Law of loving God with all the heart, there may in regard of theſe <hi>expreſſions</hi> be room for a <hi>Nidabah,</hi> a free-will offering and Performance: and though we cannot in this life attain to a ſinleſs perfection; yet out of a love to God we may in ſome Acts of Piety or Mercy, and the like imperate Acts of divine Love, perform more then any Law in <hi>particular</hi> requires of us; and conſequently this <hi>ſincere</hi> Love in theſe <hi>particular</hi> Acts may be capable of <hi>Degrees,</hi> and ſo either <hi>the ſame man may love more intenſely at one time then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> or <hi>two men at the ſame time, and yet both obey the precept,</hi> as has already been frequently demonſtrated; but more ſignally and <hi>ex profeſſo</hi> Sect. 13. §. 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. WE come now to examine his fifth charge. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conſider that, it will be expedient to <hi>give the Reader an account of</hi> the heads of thoſe <hi>cogent reaſons, which neceſſitated the</hi> Doctor <hi>to make uſe of that interpretation,</hi> which our <hi>Refuter</hi> ſo quarrells at, though not to any <hi>comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> with <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as he falſly ſuggeſts.</p>
               <p>§. 2. And the Firſt is, Becauſe an abſolute ſinleſs perfection is the Condition of the firſt Covenant which is not now obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to Believers, as the Condition of their Salvation; becauſe <hi>they are not under the Law, but under Grace:</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this Law now onely requires of Believers that we love him in ſincerity, and with our utmoſt endeavour above all things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second, If Love were not capable of degrees, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in one indiviſible point of perfection, to which all, by this Law, muſt arrive <hi>ſub periculo animae,</hi> then there could be no <hi>growth in grace;</hi> and whatſoever Act of Love, or Piety, or Charity came ſhort of this degree, were a ſin; which is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to ſo many Goſpel <hi>Precepts,</hi> and the Parable of the <hi>Talents,</hi> and the manner of Gods proceedings at the day of Judgement, when he <hi>ſhall reward every man according to his works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Third, Becauſe it is contrary to the whole Goſpel frame <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. 1 Pet. 2. 2. 2 Pet. 3. 18. 2 Cor. 8. 6.</note> and temper, which is a ſtate of conſtant <hi>proficiency</hi> and growth; and therefore Believers at their firſt admiſſion and incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into Chriſt are ſaid to be <hi>begotten to a lively Hope,</hi> to be
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:119243:249"/> and truth, he loathes this <hi>double mindedneſs;</hi> it is as offenſive as lukewarm water is to the ſtomack, that cauſes loathing and vomiting; and therefore God threatens to <hi>ſpue ſuch an one out of his mouth.</hi> But then the young <hi>Infant Chriſtian,</hi> the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Revel. 3. 16.</note> regenerate is as much owned by God for a <hi>child,</hi> as he that is <hi>grown up.</hi> There be <hi>Babes in Grace,</hi> as well as <hi>perfect men in Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> nay and <hi>Embrio's</hi> too yet in the <hi>womb</hi> of the Church. For S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes of his <hi>Galathians,</hi> that <hi>he travailed again in birth with them, till Chriſt were formed in them.</hi> God <note place="margin">Galat. 4. 19.</note> in the meaneſt <hi>Infant</hi> and firſt <hi>new-born</hi> Chriſtian beholds all the <hi>ſhape</hi> and <hi>Pourtraicture,</hi> and all the <hi>lineaments</hi> of his ſon. Chriſt is <hi>perfectly formed</hi> in them; and therefore God owns them for his children, though they be not yet grown up. They have a <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>parts,</hi> and increaſing and growing on they are to a <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>degrees;</hi> they have a perfection of <hi>ſhape,</hi> though yet they have not a perfection of <hi>ſtature;</hi> and they are now in their growth to the <hi>meaſure of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 12, 13, 14, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>of the fullneſs of Chriſt.</hi> Even the very <hi>ſeeds,</hi> and firſt degrees of Grace and holy love are the fruits of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and our <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and <hi>Newbirth,</hi> and <hi>inchoate Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> are the works and effects of that bleſſed <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>we are not able ſo much as to think a good thought</hi> but by his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 5.</note> aſſiſtance. And therefore the very loweſt degree of Grace, the leaſt <hi>ſpark</hi> of holy love cannot poſſibly be a ſin, and therefore in this ſenſe muſt be a <hi>perfect fullfilling</hi> of this Law, though it be not a <hi>fullfilling</hi> it in the utmoſt <hi>height</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of <hi>love.</hi> For though M. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> ſayes, <hi>Perfection ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of no degrees or growth, but rather degrees and growth in grace (which are oft commanded) argue there is no perfection in this life;</hi> yet becauſe he acknowledges that the Scriptures command <hi>degrees</hi> and <hi>growth in grace,</hi> and conſequently in the higheſt royall ſoveraign grace of holy <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> a lower degree of Love then the higheſt, muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be no ſin, becauſe commanded by God. Nay even the <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>ſin-leſs perfection,</hi> which was the utmoſt that the <hi>Law</hi> or firſt Covenant required, though it be not now attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in this life, conſiſted not in one indiviſible point, but had
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:119243:249"/> been a ſtate of proficiency and growth to us, if <hi>Adam</hi> and we had perſevered in that firſt integrity wherein he was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For this ſtate was a ſtate of <hi>Merit</hi> and <hi>Probation,</hi> not of <hi>Truſt</hi> and <hi>Reward.</hi> And then not onely <hi>Phyloſophy</hi> tells us, that the <hi>middle point,</hi> wherein <hi>virtue</hi> does conſiſt, admits of a <hi>latitude</hi> and degrees; but <hi>Grammar</hi> alſo teaches us to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>perfectus, perfectior, perfectiſſimus,</hi> becauſe <hi>Reaſon</hi> it ſelf is able to diſcover that there is nothing <hi>abſolutely, ſimply</hi> perfect, but God, whoſe Perfection is alone incapable of growth and addition and degrees, becauſe he is ſimply one and abſolutely infinite.</p>
               <p>§. 10. To the next Inference. <hi>If you ſay one of the middle degrees betwix the loweſt and the higheſt, it concerneth you to determine and ſpecifie what degree this is, below which all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Love are ſinfull; and beyond which all degrees are vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary oblations, and uncommanded worſhip;</hi> Here again I deny the <hi>Sequele.</hi> For if the Doctor ſhould aſſert, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the loweſt degree of love were a fullfilling of the law, nor the higheſt degree enjoyned, what neceſſity lies upon him therefore to fix upon a <hi>preciſe middle</hi> degree commanded, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low which all were a ſin and above which all were a freewill of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering?</hi> For may he not ſay that any one, or two or more, or all the intermediate degrees may be allowed as a fullfilling of the Law, and yet there may be room for a <hi>Nidabah,</hi> a freewill offering for all that. It may be the ſixth or the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, at leaſt it may be the eighth, that may be left for a free will offering, and what then will become of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
               <p>§. 11. And therefore to your third Inference, <hi>And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you cannot do this (as I know you cannot) I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the higheſt degree is commanded in our love of God,</hi> I muſt tell you, that here I deny the <hi>Sequele</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>§. 12. And now to demonſtrate the vanity and weakneſs of this kinde of <hi>Argumentation,</hi> and to ſhew that it will conclude
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:119243:250"/> a falſhood, as well as a truth, I ſhall make it appear by one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. It is a known truth, that though <hi>non datur Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum ad pondus;</hi> yet <hi>datur ad Juſtitiam,</hi> and our health does conſiſt in a juſt mixture of our naturall heat and moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, which as it is not ſimply the ſame in all men, ſo it is not ſtill the ſame in the very ſame man at all times. Againſt this known truth I would thus argue and prove the contrary, as ſtrongly as our <hi>Refuter</hi> does, Thus. <hi>Either the loweſt degree</hi> of heat, <hi>or ſome middle degree;</hi> or the higheſt <hi>degree</hi> is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to this <hi>Craſis,</hi> and temperature of health. <hi>If the loweſt. degree, then</hi> the Naturall heat and Temperature of men muſt be the ſame with <hi>Plantanimals</hi> or <hi>vegetables,</hi> nay with ſtones and mineralls, and the dead and the living would be of the ſame naturall heat and temper; <hi>If you ſay ſome one of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle degrees, betwixt the loweſt and the higheſt, it concerneth you to determine and ſpecifie what degree this is, below which all degrees of</hi> heat bring a <hi>Gangrene,</hi> a deadneſs, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the Parts, <hi>and beyond which all degrees of</hi> heat are a Feaver, <hi>and if you cannot do this (as I know you cannot) I ſhall conclude that the higheſt degree</hi> of heat is naturally requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a healthy conſtitution, and then the Madman was in the right, that in a fit of his phrenzy cryed out that he was <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect fire,</hi> and the burning <hi>Cauſus</hi> will not be our tormenting killing Diſeaſe, but our Nature, and we may not onely live with the <hi>Salamander</hi> in the fire, but by this argumentation, we ſhall be <hi>Metamorphoſed</hi> into it.</p>
               <p>§. 13. And therefore notwithſtanding our <hi>Refuters</hi> rare Argument, there may be a graduall difference of intenſneſs and Perfection in the <hi>Acts</hi> of that Love, that is required by this Law, as well as in the <hi>habit,</hi> which the Schools do deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine may be increaſed <hi>in infinitum,</hi> and has no preciſe term to bound it, beyond which it cannot go. It is not with Grace, as it is with Nature. Though Naturall Forms, and Qualities, that are capable of graduall intenſion, have ſet terms beyond which they cannot go, and below the firſt degree they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and at the higheſt degree they are ſomething elſe, as
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:119243:250"/> Heat in the eighth degree becomes Fire: yet God may increaſe his Graces in us, how, and in what manner he pleaſes. Though Chriſt the <hi>ſun of righteouſneſs</hi> ſtill moved in his <hi>Ecliptick</hi> of <hi>Perfection,</hi> yet all the other <hi>Planets,</hi> that receive their light from him, move in a <hi>Zodiack</hi> and under a line of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that conſiſts of a <hi>breadth</hi> and <hi>latitude of degrees,</hi> and ſometimes they in their <hi>Excentricity</hi> move without it; as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in the caſe of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> and <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> but then by the power of Gods Grace they return into their <hi>Compaſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 14. But then I ſhall make no ſcruple to grant our <hi>Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Concluſion though his Premiſes infer it not, if he will admit me to diſtinguiſh and declare, in what ſenſe I take it. For ſtill to ſpeak in generall, ambiguous, undiſtinguiſhed terms, as he does, is to confound, and not inſtruct; not to ſtate controverſies, but involve them; not to clear truth, but to cloud and mask it.</p>
               <p>§. 15. Love then whether in the Habit or the Act may be the higheſt, either <hi>abſolutely</hi> or <hi>comparatively,</hi> or to make uſe of <hi>Aquinas</hi> his diſtinction, for the greater authority, it may be ſaid to be the higheſt in a threefold conſideration. 1. Either <hi>ex parte diligibilis,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Love</hi> ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate and equall to the <hi>Object,</hi> a love as high and perfect, as that is lovely and amiable. Now this love of God, that is as high as his own goodneſs, is <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>ſimply</hi> the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, becauſe it is <hi>infinite,</hi> as God is; a Love <hi>Proper</hi> and <hi>Peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar</hi> unto <hi>God</hi> himſelf, that is <hi>infinite</hi> and <hi>eſſentiall love,</hi> one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire <hi>Act, Loving,</hi> and <hi>beloved;</hi> whoſe love muſt ſtill be equall to himſelf, becauſe it is no other, but himſelf. The Creature cannot poſſibly be obliged thus to love God, becauſe being naturally finite in its being, and all its operations, it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely impoſſible to be attained to; becauſe between that which is naturally, neceſſarily finite, and that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, there can be no proportion, and there can be but one infinite, becauſe but one God. And therefore here the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Digeſt. de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul. Juris leg.</hi> 185.</note> Rule of the Law is undoubted, and <hi>nemo tenetur ad impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
                  <pb n="460" facs="tcp:119243:251"/> and God might aſwell oblige us to be omnipotent, to raiſe the dead, and make an other world, in ſhort, be God, as thus to love him.</p>
               <p>§. 16. Secondly, Either, <hi>Ex parte diligentis,</hi> ſo that the Love be commenſurate to the <hi>power</hi> of the Lover, and he cannot tranſcend it, and this is <hi>comparatively</hi> the higheſt. And thus I grant, that the Law obliges us to love God, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>with all our ſoul, our mind, our heart, our ſtrength,</hi> every faculty both of ſoul and body muſt be wholly and to the utmoſt of our ſtrength ſtill imployed in this love.</p>
               <p>And if our Refuter mean no other but this by his <hi>ex toto poſſe ſuo,</hi> he ſhall not find an Adverſary of me or the Doctor in this.</p>
               <p>§. 17. But then becauſe this is yet too generall, and our <hi>Refuter,</hi> I perceive, has other thoughts, and means another thing by theſe terms then the Doctor does, and becauſe <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet dolus in generalibus,</hi> I ſhall (to come out of theſe miſts and clouds of diſcourſe) yet be more Particular. For the <hi>Abilities</hi> of man being <hi>diverſe</hi> in <hi>ſundry reſpects,</hi> it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary clearly to expreſſe of what <hi>Abilities</hi> we ſpeak, when we ſay man is obliged to Love God to the <hi>utmoſt of his Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 18. I ſay then further, That mans <hi>Abilities</hi> may be conſidered according to his threefold ſtate, <hi>Paſt, Preſent</hi> and <hi>Future.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 19. If we conſider Man according to thoſe <hi>Abilities,</hi> he had in his firſt eſtate in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> we ſhall find, that as he came innocent and ſpotleſs from the hands of ſo pure and undefiled an <hi>Artificer,</hi> ſo God beſtowed upon him the <hi>Habit</hi> of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall Juſtice</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> whereby he was enabled to ſerve God and love him to the height of <hi>ſinleſs perfection.</hi> But then as we have already obſerved, even this very ſtate of <hi>ſinleſs Perfection</hi> was a ſtate of <hi>growth</hi> and <hi>Proficiency,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:119243:251"/> it was a ſtate of <hi>Merit.</hi> And <hi>Adam</hi> was left in a capacity to improve his <hi>Talents</hi> of grace, and to grow in Love, as well, as we are now. Now the <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Naturall gratitude</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging man to love God <hi>withall his ſtrength,</hi> muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty alſo oblige him to a <hi>ſin-leſs perfection</hi> of love and ſervice to God in all the Commandments. And this was the Condition of the <hi>Firſt Covenant, Fac hoc &amp; vives,</hi> Do this, and thou ſhalt live, whereby man was to have been Juſtified.</p>
               <p>§. 20. But though <hi>God made man upright, yet he found out many Inventions;</hi> he fell, and forfeited thoſe Abilities God <note place="margin">Eccſeſ. 7. 10.</note> gave him, not onely for <hi>himſelf,</hi> but for all his <hi>Poſterity.</hi> The <hi>Attainder</hi> did extend to the <hi>Race</hi> for the grand <hi>Treaſon</hi> of the <hi>Father;</hi> and <hi>impoſſible it is, that by the works of the Law fleſh and blood can be Juſtified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 21. But then this <hi>ſinleſſe perfection</hi> and height of Love, as it is impoſſible now to be attained, ſo it is not obligatory to the <hi>Juſtification</hi> of <hi>believers,</hi> that <hi>are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> The Condition of the <hi>ſecond Covenant,</hi> whereby we muſt all be juſtified, is <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>ſincere holy endeavours,</hi> which ſuppoſes the <hi>Fall,</hi> and Mans <hi>frail, ſinfull,</hi> weak condition.</p>
               <p>§. 22.

<pb n="462" facs="tcp:119243:252"/> to the <hi>Romanes</hi> and <hi>Galathians,</hi> when he diſputes with the <hi>Jew,</hi> that expected Juſtification without <hi>Faith,</hi> Juſtification by their own <hi>works,</hi> according to the tenor of that Part of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> Law, that exemplified the <hi>Condition</hi> of the <hi>firſt Covenant,</hi> and affixed the <hi>Curſe</hi> to <hi>every one that continued not in every thing that was written in the book of the law to do them.</hi> And according to this <hi>Tenor,</hi> this <hi>Condition</hi> of the <hi>law</hi> the Apoſtle demonſtratively proves againſt the <hi>Jew</hi> from the <hi>law,</hi> that no <hi>fleſh living can be juſtified,</hi> becauſe that <hi>law</hi> expreſly teſtifies that <hi>all men have ſinned and fell ſhort of the glory of God.</hi> According to this <hi>Condition</hi> expreſſed in <hi>Moſes law,</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> muſt acknowledge, that if he expects to be <hi>Juſtified,</hi> his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs muſt be ſo <hi>exact,</hi> that he muſt not tranſgreſs in any <hi>leaſt branch</hi> of any the <hi>leaſt commandment.</hi> If he does, as his own <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and the <hi>law</hi> tels him plainly, that he does, he muſt of neceſſity acknowledge that by this <hi>law,</hi> nor he, nor any man elſe can be <hi>Juſtified,</hi> much leſs <hi>ſupererogate,</hi> and do more then that <hi>law</hi> requires. And therefore of neceſſity he muſt acknowledge himſelf in a <hi>damnable</hi> ſtate, if he will ſtand to be <hi>Juſtified</hi> by that <hi>law,</hi> and his <hi>own righteouſneſs.</hi> No hope there can be for him, unleſs he look for <hi>another righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> another <hi>Covenant;</hi> a Righteouſneſs <hi>without him,</hi> and a <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi> This is it that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſo demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratively proves againſt the <hi>Jew,</hi> and clearly evidences that as <hi>no man</hi> can be <hi>Juſtified</hi> by that <hi>firſt Covenant,</hi> ſo <hi>Abraham the Father of the Faithfull,</hi> and all that ever were Juſtified, were Juſtified by <hi>faith</hi> in the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and the <hi>ſecond Covenant</hi> made and confirmed in his blood.</p>
               <p>§. 23. And this is the <hi>Righteouſneſs we preach, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi>

               <p>§. 24. But then not this, but the former Legall Perfection of Charity is the Love that <hi>Chamier</hi> ſpeaks of, in his diſpute with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> when he ſayes we muſt love God according to the Tenor and Preſcript of this Law, <hi>totis viribus Naturae, non totis viribus corruptionis.</hi> And of ſuch a ſinleſs Perfection of love it is alſo, that Maſter <hi>Cawdrey</hi> ſpeaks, and Doctor <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> denyes to be obligatory to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Juſtification, that is not, <hi>cannot be Juſtified by the works of the law,</hi> but is therefore by Gods Mercy and Chriſts Merit and Purchaſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace.</hi> And of a love according to this ſinleſs height it is that our <hi>Refuter</hi> ſpeaks, and would make good againſt the Doctor. But bate him his Argument called <hi>Petitio Principii,</hi> and he has not proved it.

               <p>§. 25. For it is one thing to ſay that the <hi>Law,</hi> or <hi>Covenant of works,</hi> that required <hi>unſinning</hi> obedience as the <hi>condition</hi> of <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> by that <hi>Law,</hi> requires us to love God to that height, and another thing to ſay, that the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is obliged ſo to love God to <hi>Juſtification.</hi> For that infers that <hi>believers</hi> are yet <hi>under the law,</hi> when <hi>they are not, but under grace;</hi> which is contrary to the <hi>Tenor</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> and yet for all that it may be true, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> demonſtrates, that the <hi>Covenant of works,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> as he calls it, did require <hi>ſuch obedience,</hi> and therefore no man can be <hi>Juſtified</hi> by <hi>that covenant</hi> or <hi>Law,</hi> but by <hi>ſuch obedience,</hi> and ſuch a height of Love.</p>
               <p>§. 26. If then ſecondly Man be confidered in regard of thoſe <hi>Abilities</hi> he has now in the <hi>Preſent ſtate</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> and under the <hi>Goſpell diſpenſation,</hi> I ſay that Man, according

The love ſhall be ſtill one in every man, as the Crown of glory ſhall eternally be the ſame. A love at the utmoſt height, that the lover of God, whoſoever he is, ſhall ever eternally obtain.

               <p>§. 31. This is the love we all hope for and aim at, and muſt endeavour after; and it will be our ſin, and our miſery, if we do not attain to it. But then it is the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>§. 32. Thirdly, the love may be the higheſt, <hi>ex parte dile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionis ſeu Formae aut Actus Amoris praeciſè conſiderati.</hi> a love in the higheſt degree, not as in this or that <hi>ſubject</hi> planted, but in the utmoſt degree that the <hi>form</hi> or <hi>Quality</hi> it ſelf is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and eſſentially capable of.</p>
               <p>§. 33. For the better underſtanding of which it is to be conſidered; that the Philoſopher, the better to explain the
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:119243:255"/> nature of Intenſion and Remiſſion of Naturall Forms and Qualities (whoſe eſſence conſiſts in a latitude) divides this latitude of Eſſence into <hi>eight degrees</hi> of <hi>Intenſion</hi> or <hi>Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> below which they are nothing, and beyond which they become ſomething elſe, <hi>ſubſtantiall</hi> forms, and not <hi>Accidents.</hi> Now though this be true of all Naturall forms, becauſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally they have their <hi>intrinſick</hi> bounds of being and growth (it being as true of Naturall Forms, as of Naturall Bodies; becauſe <hi>Nature,</hi> or rather <hi>God</hi> works all things of this kind in <hi>number, weight</hi> and <hi>meaſure)</hi> yet it is not ſo in reſpect of <hi>Grace,</hi> and thoſe <hi>infuſed Qualities,</hi> that are the immediate iſſues and fruits of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> Theſe being purely dependent upon Gods good will and pleaſure, have no <hi>determinate</hi> bounds and limits as all Naturall Formes have, but may be greater or leſſer, more or leſs perfect, gradually higher or lower as God himſelf thinks fit. There is no one <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be ſo high, that it can be no higher, or ceaſe to be Grace: nor can we love God ſo fervently, but that by the aſſiſtance of the Spirit, we may be enabled to love him more fervently.</p>
               <p>§. 34. Though then <hi>Philoſophy</hi> acknowledges but eight degrees of latitude in the graduall intenſion and Remiſſion of naturall forms; yet <hi>Theology</hi> allows no ſuch <hi>preciſe</hi> number for <hi>ſpirituall</hi> Forms and <hi>Graces.</hi> They may by Gods Power be intended <hi>in infinitum,</hi> and the more they are augmented, the perfecter ſtill they are. And conſequently no man can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign any one degree of Love, that he can in reſpect of the <hi>Form,</hi> perfectly call the <hi>higheſt</hi> degree of Love, no more then he can ſhew me any one Number ſo great, that cannot be made greater by an Addition of numbers, or Multiplication of it ſelf upon its ſelf. And therefore, as we have obſerved, <hi>Aquinas</hi> and the Schoolmen determine, that <hi>charitas poteſt augeri in infinitum</hi> 2. 2. q. 24. art. 4. And yet our Refuter that calls himſelf a Schoolman, tells us of a <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>middle degrees</hi> of Love, and an <hi>eight</hi> which he calls the <hi>higheſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 35. And yet if we ſhould allow <hi>degrees</hi> of Love (as
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:119243:255"/> we muſt) and for argumentation ſake, we ſhould pitch upon a <hi>preciſe</hi> number, ſuppoſe of <hi>eight</hi> (as the Doctor does in his <hi>Account</hi> to Maſter <hi>Cawdrey)</hi> yet then every degree muſt be allowed (as the Doctor excellently obſerves) to be like the <hi>Aſtronomers</hi> degrees in their <hi>Circles,</hi> for inſtance of <hi>Longitude</hi> and <hi>Latitude,</hi> that are divided into <hi>Seconds</hi> and <hi>Thirds</hi> and <hi>Fourths,</hi> &amp;c. and every one of theſe <hi>Fractions</hi> into <hi>ſixty</hi> parts and <hi>fractions</hi> more, and ſo on <hi>in infinitum,</hi> if their Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Art ſo require it.</p>
               <p>§. 36. And therefore our <hi>Refuter</hi> might as well tell the world of the <hi>Production</hi> of the <hi>Quadrature</hi> of a <hi>Circle,</hi> or a <hi>Naturall</hi> Temperature <hi>ad Pondus,</hi> or the <hi>exiſtence</hi> of a <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonicall Idea,</hi> as of the <hi>higheſt degree</hi> of holy <hi>Love,</hi> that is <hi>preciſely</hi> the <hi>eighth,</hi> no more nor no leſs, to which all men are obliged. But he, becauſe he is a <hi>Schoolman,</hi> may talk or write any thing, and the world muſt admire him for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>School-terms,</hi> which becauſe they make a ſtrange noiſe and ſound in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> muſt needs be deep ſtuff, though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Writer, nor the Reader underſtand them. But <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> and <hi>Riddles</hi> are therefore <hi>Oracles</hi> and <hi>Riddles</hi> becauſe they are dark, and obſcure, and they therefore gain the <hi>more vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> and reſpect, the <hi>leſs</hi> they are <hi>underſtood.</hi> Now this is that <hi>height of Perfection</hi> to a <hi>degree</hi> that the Doctor denyes, for the reaſons formerly aſſigned, and our <hi>Refuter</hi> undertakes to make good by this Argument.</p>
               <p>§. 37. And now that the Doctor is in the right, beſides the Reaſons formerly alledged, I thus further make good by our <hi>Refuters</hi> own Argument.</p>
               <p>§. 38. Thus then I retort it. <hi>If neither the loweſt degree of love, nor the higheſt degree of Love be required by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, then certainly ſome one, or all of the middle degrees are commanded, or elſe none at all, but ſome degrees of love at leaſt is required, and not the loweſt nor the higheſt, ergo.</hi> Not the <hi>loweſt,</hi> for the reaſon aſſigned by our <hi>Refuter</hi> (which for Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:119243:256"/> ſake, and onely <hi>ad hominem</hi> we will admit of) nor the <hi>higheſt,</hi> which our <hi>Refuter</hi> contends for, becauſe then every degree of love, which is not thus the higheſt, would be a ſin, becauſe a tranſgreſſion of that commandment of Love, that our <hi>Refuter</hi> ſayes requires the higheſt. But then this is moſt notoriouſly falſe, and directly contrary to many places of Scripture that command <hi>growth</hi> in grace, that tell us that every <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> is the fruit and effect of his holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is the onely <hi>fountain</hi> of <hi>holineſs,</hi> and cannot therefore be Author of any thing that is not pure and holy. <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, new birth,</hi> and <hi>inchoate</hi> ſanctification are the works of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as well as <hi>growth</hi> and the <hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and Love, and <hi>every good gift and every perfect gift</hi> (as that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <note place="margin">James 1. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.</note> any fruit of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and holineſs) <hi>comes down from above, from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableneſs, nor ſhadow of change:</hi> with whom is neither <hi>variation, decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> nor <hi>Parallax;</hi> but one <hi>infinite point,</hi> and Act of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, one Perfect <hi>ſun of Righteouſneſs, with healing in his wings,</hi> that like the <hi>ſun</hi> it ſelf, the fountain of naturall light (according to the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of <hi>Galileus, Copernicus, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus)</hi> ſtands ſtill in one immoveable <hi>Center</hi> of the world, and gives light and heat and Influence and motion to all things in the world.

                  <hi>Proteſtants</hi> againſt the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> ſay, is required to Juſtification, and according to the Tenor of the firſt Covenant, which therefore they ſay is neceſſary; becauſe the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſpeak of a <hi>Juſtification</hi> by <hi>works,</hi> a fullfilling of the <hi>Law,</hi> and merit <hi>ex condigno, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> and works of <hi>Supererogation.</hi> This our <hi>Refuter</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to maintain to be now required of Chriſtians to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,</hi> otherwiſe he has no oppoſite.

And if our Refuter be his Adverſary in this, let him try his School-skill, and anſwer our arguments, in a School-way, and leave his begging of the queſtion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The loving God according to the Abilities and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages we ſhall have in heaven, when we ſhall ſee God face to face, is the Perfection of <hi>Saints,</hi> and thoſe of the Church<hi>-Triumphant,</hi> not the duty of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and thoſe of the Church <hi>Militant,</hi> more then <hi>ſincerely</hi> to <hi>endeavour</hi> after it, and by comparing their <hi>weakneſs</hi> with the <hi>uprightneſs</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and the Perfection of this Love, they may have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to <hi>humble</hi> them, and <hi>long</hi> for, and to fly to Ckriſts
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:119243:257"/> Righteouſneſs, and Mediation, and Gods Mercy. And though our <hi>Refuter</hi> bring after the Authorities of <hi>Austin, Bernard, Aquinas,</hi> and <hi>Scotus,</hi> to prove that to this we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are obliged by the Law, yet I ſhall demonſtratively prove anon, that they ſay it not, but the contrary: and ſo our <hi>Refuter</hi> ſtands alone, and naked, like the Shrub on the point of a Rock, or the top of a Maſt in open Sea in a ſtorm, that has nothing to ſuccour it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That there is no one degree in this Quality and Grace of holy love, ſo high, beyond which there can be no higher, or it cannot go, but it muſt ceaſe to be love, and become ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe: and conſequently we cannot be obliged to love God in any one degree preciſely, much leſſe in the eighth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree which is the higheſt, as our <hi>Refuter</hi> and Maſter <hi>Cawdrey</hi> maintain.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That believers by this <hi>old,</hi> this <hi>new Commandment</hi> of Love (as <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 22. 39. Joh. 13. 34.</note> our Saviour and S. <hi>John</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 7, 8. 2 Joh. 4. 5.</note> calls it) are obliged to Love God to the utmoſt of their Power, and ſincerely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to grow more in grace and the knowledge of our Lord, that ſo they may be enabled ſtill to love him the more. The onely meaſure of love here being to love him without meaſure, not fixing upon any bounds or limits of love. And this is that the Doctor and the moſt learned of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> maintain and let him ſee if he can diſprove it, and make what advantage he can by it.</p>
               <p>§. 40. But now though all this is ſaid and demonſtratively proved, I muſt tell our <hi>Refuter,</hi> that all this is nothing to the preſent controverſie depending between him and the Doctor: I muſt grant it indeed, to be very uſefull in it ſelf, and very fit to be known, and better conſidered, then oftentimes it is. And in this reſpect I thank our <hi>Refuter</hi> for his <hi>digreſſion,</hi> that has thus occaſioned mine. And withall I muſt adde, that though all were granted which now he contends for, it would no whit at all concern the Doctors aſſertion: Becauſe the Doctor expreſly in very many places, eſpecially in the defence of his Treatiſe of <hi>Will-worſhip,</hi> profeſſes not to ſpeak of <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi>

               <p>§. 2. To this I anſwer, Firſt, that this is not the Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he undertook to make good. For he promiſed to evince by theſe following Reaſons, That <hi>this commandment enjoyneth a love of God, with as high a degree as is poſſible unto the humane Nature,</hi> which this Proof no way reaches. For it is one thing to love God with our <hi>utmoſt forces and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and as much as we can,</hi> and another thing <hi>to love him with as high a degree as is poſſible to the humane nature.</hi> The <hi>former</hi> may be, and is <hi>obligatory</hi> to the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> though this <hi>latter</hi> is not.</p>
               <p>§. 3. Secondly, I therefore anſwer, That all is granted that this Argument contends for.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Obliged we are not onely by <hi>an obligation of congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and gratitude,</hi> but alſo by many other obligations, not here named, to love God with a <hi>moſt intenſe love,</hi> with the utmoſt of our forces and endeavours. The Doctor grants
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:119243:258"/> and expreſly proves it, by the Teſtimony of the ſon of <hi>Syrach,</hi> Ecclus. 43. 30. <hi>When you glorifie God the Lord, exalt him as much as you can, and when you exalt him put forth all your ſtrength, for you can never go far enough. i. e.</hi> ſayes the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, <hi>how far ſoever you exceed the Particular command you are yet within the compaſs of the generall</hi> (one of love he means) <hi>and in reſpect of that can never be thought to have done enough, though the Particular Act or the degree of it, be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that you are not particularly obliged to.</hi> The words are full and high, and to all the Argument pretends to.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Becauſe God is infinite in perfection, infinitely good, and infinitely amiable, we, that are finite in our Natures and Operations, can never love him enough, and as much as he deſerves; and becauſe all our ſufficiency is from God, <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall gratitude,</hi> if there were no other Rule and Law, would oblige us to imploy all that ſtrength and ſufficiency in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, from whom alone all is derived. And becauſe when we have done all we can, we ſhould yet be ſhort of loving him ſufficiently, and to the height of his worth and Perfection, ſtill labour we muſt, that we may yet more and more love him, and becauſe this life is too ſhort, endeavour we may and muſt to be admitted into heaven, where we may love him to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt height we can, or ſhall ever attain; and becauſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love him <hi>infinitely,</hi> as his goodneſs deſerves, we yet may love him <hi>eternally. Ratio diligendi Deum eſt Deus ipſe, modus ſine modo,</hi> ſaies S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſweetly, that never ſpeaks other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. <hi>The onely Reaſon, and Motive to our Love of God, muſt be his own Goodneſs,</hi> and the onely Meaſure of this Love, muſt be Love without Meaſure. Becauſe God is Infinite in Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, our Love muſt alſo be <hi>Infinite;</hi> not <hi>abſolutely,</hi> as God is, but onely <hi>in a ſort,</hi> that befits our <hi>finite</hi> condition. Our Love muſt be infinite <hi>Syncategorematicè</hi> as they ſpeak in the <hi>Schools,</hi> though <hi>Categorematicè</hi> it cannot. That is, though the word <hi>Infinite,</hi> cannot be predicated of our Love <hi>in caſu re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto,</hi> yet it may <hi>in caſu obliquo;</hi> though it cannot be <hi>Poſitively</hi> infinite, yet <hi>Negatively</hi> it may, and muſt; though ſtill it will
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:119243:259"/> be <hi>finite,</hi> yet it muſt have no <hi>ſet,</hi> no <hi>determinate</hi> bounds and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits. Though our love cannot be <hi>infinite,</hi> yet we muſt <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely</hi> love him, love him <hi>in infinitum,</hi> and never think we can love him ſufficiently, and unto the utmoſt height, beyond which we neither can, nor need to go. Our work and labour of love, muſt be like to the <hi>Arithmeticians</hi> Operation in <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive Multiplication.</hi> The further he goes on in his work, the more is the <hi>Product,</hi> and the greater ſtill his <hi>Task.</hi> And if this will content our <hi>Refuter,</hi> he has mine and the Doctors free grant, and I hope in this we ſhall be friends.</p>

               <p>§. 9. Indeed I am half perſwaded that upon a ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, and more ſetled thoughts, our <hi>Refuter</hi> himſelf will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that it is no very difficult Task. For though it be granted, that <hi>a moſt intenſe actuall Love of God is due unto God, by an obligation of gratitude, becauſe hereby (as Doctor</hi> Francis White <hi>againſt</hi> Fiſher <hi>out of</hi> Bernard) <hi>we are indebted and owe to the Almighty,</hi> omne quod ſumus, &amp; omne quod poſſumus, <hi>whatſoever we are, and whatſoever we are able to do;</hi> yet this <note n="*" place="margin">B. <hi>White,</hi> Reply to <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers</hi> anſwer, Point. 8. §. 3. pag. 533.

               </p>
               <p>§. 10. No claſhing then here betwixt Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> and Doctor <hi>White,</hi> unleſs our <hi>Refuter</hi> will make that learned man firſt to quarrell with himſelf, who poſitively grants, and acknowledges that Truth which Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> maintains.</p>
               <p>§. 11. But then, though Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> is not confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet thanks to our <hi>Ames,</hi> Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is <hi>confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> and <hi>confounded</hi> for all that.</p>
               <p>§. 12. And let him be ſo for me. I owe him not ſo much ſervice to come with a Candle and Lanthorn at Noon to find his Carcaſſe at the foot of your divinity chair. Nor have I
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:119243:260"/> taken Fee from any of his Party, to be an Advocate in his cauſe. And I think they would but laugh at us both, If I ſhould undertake to make it good. Let him and his Party ſtand and fall to their own Maſter. I am ſure <hi>they are of Age,</hi> at leaſt they pretend <hi>Antiquity</hi> enough, and therefore <hi>let</hi> them <hi>ſpeak for themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 13. Howſoever, I ſhall expreſs my preſent haſty thoughts of both places, as well <hi>Bellarmines,</hi> as <hi>Ames;</hi> that to me they ſeem not to be ſo oppoſite as our <hi>Refuter</hi> would make his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der believe, and that the difference between them is rather in the <hi>expreſſion,</hi> then the <hi>thing</hi> it ſelf. And I believe that <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> will not refuſe to ſubſcribe <hi>Ames</hi> his <hi>Retort,</hi> and yet for all that <hi>Ames</hi> will not deny but that <note n="*" place="margin">Any men, all men are bound to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to the perfection of holineſs, not the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. <hi>Caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreys</hi> triplex Diatribe. pag. 109.</note> 
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpeaks truth, when he ſayes, all men are not bound to love God, ſo as to be <hi>Martyrs,</hi> or <hi>Virgins,</hi> or what other elſe he calls <hi>ſtates,</hi> or <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Perfection.</hi> And yet this is all that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſeems (to me at leaſt) to drive at, and if it were worth the enquiry, I ſhould be content to be taught this ſo wonderfull deep point, as the underſtanding a piece in <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> But the Reader if he pleaſe may turn to <hi>Bellarmine de Monachis l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 13. <hi>Col. mihi</hi> 350. <hi>D.

               <p>§. 14. But let <hi>Ames</hi> his <hi>Reply</hi> be as <hi>round and acute,</hi> as our <hi>Refuter</hi> thinks fit, I ſhall be ſo far from envying that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations the Author does deſerve in his pains againſt <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> that I love, and uſe to read him for it.</p>
               <p>§. 15. But what I pray is all this to Doctor <hi>Hammond?</hi> is <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Ghoſt by any <hi>Pythagorean Metempſychoſis</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into the Doctor? or has the Doctor wedded or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced this ſaying of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> that <hi>Ames</hi> confutes? How then is he concerned?</p>
               <p>§. 16. Without doubt, very much! For the vulgar Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cannot chuſe but think the Doctors opinion to be <hi>popiſhly</hi>
                  <pb n="479" facs="tcp:119243:260"/> affected, becauſe our <hi>Refuter</hi> in his anſwer to the Doctor ſo eagerly confutes <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and urges againſt him Doctor <hi>White</hi> and Doctor <hi>Ames.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 17. It was an art of Cruelty practiſed againſt the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians, to put them into the skins of <hi>Wolves</hi> and <hi>Bears,</hi> that they might be baited more fiercely in the Theaters. And I remember to have read in Maſter <hi>Fox,</hi> of one of our Martyrs that being condemned to the ſtake, was forced to his execution in a coat all painted over with <hi>Devils,</hi> that ſo the <hi>rabble</hi> and multitude of ſpectators might be moved by this <hi>dreſs</hi> ſo to loathe and hate the <hi>Perſon,</hi> as not to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his <hi>conſtancy</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> in his ſufferings. And if our <hi>Refuter</hi> had any ſuch deſign, I muſt look upon it, as a very <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly</hi> practiſe, and a piece of <hi>Tyranny,</hi> not much inferiour to that of <hi>Mezentius,</hi> to couple the <hi>living</hi> and the <hi>dead,</hi> that the ill favour of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> name might poyſon the Doctors living ſpotleſs <hi>repute,</hi> and kill it in the Breaſts of thoſe that read him, but much more of thoſe that read him not.</p>
               <p>§. 18. But if this was the deſign of our <hi>Refuter,</hi> I muſt tell the Doctor for his comfort, that he has not onely the <hi>Martyrs</hi> for his <hi>companions</hi> in this piece of <hi>Perſecution,</hi> but our <hi>Saviour alſo</hi> for his <hi>pattern</hi> and <hi>preſident.</hi> He was cloathed in a <hi>purple Robe,</hi> and he had a <hi>Reed</hi> for a <hi>Scepter,</hi> and a <hi>crown of thorns</hi> on his head, and they <hi>bowed the knee before him,</hi> and cryed out <hi>hayl King,</hi> though he alwayes profeſſed his <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was not of this world,</hi> and commanded us to <hi>Render to Caeſar the things that are Caeſars.</hi> But I go on, and ſo does our <hi>Refuter.</hi>

               <p>§. 2. <hi>For the Confirmation of this Point.</hi> What <hi>Point, I</hi> pray, is this, Sir? Do you not <hi>Antipheron</hi> like, of whom the Philoſopher tells us, that having a fault in his brain, the Organs of his ſight ſtill carried his <hi>own Reflection</hi> and ſhape and <hi>effigies</hi> before him whereſoever he went? And do you not all along in this controverſie, ſtill carry your <hi>own ſhadow,</hi> and <hi>Phantaſm,</hi> that an Error in your Intellectuals has created, before your thoughts? It is that <hi>point</hi> of your <hi>own framing,</hi> that ſtill runs in your head, and no <hi>aſſertion</hi> of the Doctors. For he has ſo often expreſly declared that he ſpeaks not of <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs perfection,</hi> when he ſayes it admits of uncommanded de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, but onely of the <hi>ſincerity</hi> of this or that <hi>particular vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> or <hi>Grace</hi> in this or that <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>performance,</hi> that I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed ſo often to remind you of it.</p>
               <p>§. 3. And yet it is for the neceſſity of this <hi>ſinleſs perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and compleat obedience to all Gods commandments, this perfect habit of Divine Love and holy Charity that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> in the Controverſies about <hi>Juſtification</hi> by <hi>works</hi> and Merit <hi>ex condigno,</hi> &amp;c. do make uſe of theſe Authorities of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and <hi>Bernard,</hi> and the <hi>School-men.</hi> But then this concerns not at all the Doctor, who meddles not here with theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies. Howſoever I obſerve it is confutation ſufficient to Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> and it is no leſs then one of <hi>Hercules</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours that the <hi>Protestants</hi> have <hi>alledged</hi> the Authority of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi>
                  <pb n="482" facs="tcp:119243:262"/> and <hi>Bernard</hi> for the <hi>confirmation</hi> of this, which onely flotes in our <hi>Refuters</hi> brain, and is no where to be found in the <hi>writings</hi> of the Doctor.</p>
               <p>§. 4. But then as to the ſayings preſſed from <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Bernard,</hi> they are not denyed even by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to be found <note place="margin">

               <p>§. 5. But then our <hi>Refuter</hi> will never be able to prove that ſuch a perfection of love that is not onely <hi>ſinleſs,</hi> but Perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>all Act,</hi> one interrupted, conſtant, and eternall Act of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love, and nothing elſe (which is the Perfection they ſpeak of) was ever commanded to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, much leſs to us Chriſtians, that are not now under the <hi>Law</hi> and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works, but under <hi>Grace,</hi> and the Mercy of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell.

               <p>§. 9.

And if theſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you ſay, you <hi>trouble the Reader,</hi> are the moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that you conceive are to be found in <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Scotus</hi> concerning this matter, you muſt give me leave to tell you, that your Reading in thoſe Authors is not very great, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you are a <hi>School man,</hi> nor your Remarques and <hi>Ré<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherches</hi> very deep, very pertinent and Judicious. I doubt not but that I, in my ſlender obſervation, and ſmall reading in thoſe Authours, ſhall obſerve the <hi>quite contrary</hi> to what you labour to perſwade your Reader.</p>
               <p>§. 11. For your firſt quotation of <hi>Aquinas ſecundâ ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dae. q.</hi> 44. <hi>art.</hi> 6. I muſt ſay, that if you had rendred it entire, and faithfully, as it lyes in <hi>Aquinas,</hi> it would have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, before it had been objected. I repreſent it then at large. It is <hi>in Corp.</hi> thus. <hi>Dicendum quod praeceptum aliquod du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter poteſt impleri, uno modo Perfectè, alio modo imperfectè, Perfectè quidem impletur praeceptum, quando perveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ad finem quem intendit Praecipiens: Impletur, ſed</hi>
                  <pb n="486" facs="tcp:119243:264"/> 
                  <hi>imperfectè, quando et ſi non pertingat ad finem Praecipientis, non tamen receditur ab ordine ad finem, ſicut ſi dux exercitus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiat militibus, ut pugnent, ille perfectè implet praeceptum, qui pugnando hoſtem vincit, quod dux intendit. Ille autem im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plet, ſed imperfectè cujus pugna ad victoriam non pertingit, non tamen contra diſciplinam militarem agit. Intendit autem De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us per hoc praeceptum</hi> (and this, this is the Paſſage our <hi>Refuter</hi> inſiſts on) <hi>ut homo ſibi totaliter uniatur, quod fiet in Patrià, quando Deus erit omnia in omnibus. Et ideo plenè &amp; perfectè in Patriâ implebitur hoc praeceptum, in viâ autem impletur, ſed imperfectè. Et tamen in via tanto unus alio perfectius implet, quanto magis accedit per quandam ſimilitudinem ad Patriae per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionem.</hi> The meaning of <hi>Aquinas</hi> is this. In every Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or command we are to conſider the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Legiſlator,</hi> and the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Law.</hi> This is the performance of the duty enjoyned, which the <hi>Legiſlator</hi> commands, as a <hi>means</hi> for the attainment of that end, which he himſelf did intend and aime at, when he publiſhed the Law. For inſtance. A <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall</hi> intends and deſigns the taking this city or that Fortreſſe, and therefore he rallies up his Forces, and commands them to ſtorm it. They do ſo; and if they gain the City by aſſault, the <hi>Commander</hi> has his <hi>end,</hi> which he firſt intended, when he gave the word of command, and the ſoldier has done his <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> which was the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Precept:</hi> but if they ſtorm it, and are repulſed, though the <hi>Generall</hi> has miſſed his <hi>Aime,</hi> yet the <hi>Soldier</hi> has not broken the <hi>Precept,</hi> and did as much as the <hi>Commandment,</hi> though not as much as the <hi>Commander</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. It is juſt ſo in the preſent caſe, according to <hi>Aquinas</hi>'s doctrine. God, when he firſt made man, <hi>intended</hi> to make him eternally happy by a full enjoyment, and ſight and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect love of himſelf. But becauſe he made him upright, and of a nature as well capable of ſerving, as of enjoying his maker, he preſcribed him a <hi>Law,</hi> as a <hi>Means</hi> for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this <hi>happineſs.</hi> The Law was, <hi>Thou ſhalt Love the Lord, with all thy heart, or as much as thou art able,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſtrength, and that grace I beſtow upon thee (For God <hi>dwelling in inacceſſible light,</hi> cannot be known and
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:119243:264"/> loved by us any other way then as God <hi>enables</hi> us to know and to love him) and then he promiſed to admit man to a clear ſight and full fruition, and perfect love of himſelf. This was <hi>Gods end</hi> when he firſt made the <hi>Law;</hi> and our <hi>duty,</hi> and the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>command</hi> it ſelf was, that we ſhould love him to the utmoſt of that power and ſtrength which he ſhould give us to love him. If therefore we conſider the <hi>Perfection</hi> of that Love, and that happineſs, which God <hi>intended,</hi> we ſhould ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at by the enjoyment of himſelf in heaven, this is mans <hi>duty</hi> to aime at, becauſe it is his <hi>laſt end</hi> and the perfection God intended to bring him to at firſt, when he made him. But then becauſe it is <hi>incompatible</hi> with our preſent ſtate and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as we are in the body, God made it not the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Precept,</hi> though it was that which he intended we ſhould ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at, though it were <hi>our laſt end</hi> and <hi>his deſign,</hi> when at firſt he created us. For otherwiſe he had preſcribed us an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible duty,</hi> that we ſhould be happy in <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> and yet in the <hi>way</hi> to it; that we ſhould be preſent with him, and ſee him face to face, and yet be abſent from him, which implyes a contradiction. And therefore he requires of us as our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a <hi>lower</hi> kind of love, a love ſuitable to our preſent ſtate, that we ſhould love him as much as we can, and as much as he has <hi>enabled</hi> us to love him. This is the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and the other <hi>Gods end,</hi> that enjoyned the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That is our <hi>duty,</hi> and this our <hi>crown,</hi> and <hi>reward.</hi> This God commands us to <hi>aime</hi> at, to <hi>labour</hi> for, and <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> after, as much as we can whilſt we are in this life, and the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>means</hi> to it is the Performance of this command in the loving him here according to our <hi>utmoſt abilities,</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours.</hi> And this is not an <hi>impoſſible duty,</hi> but an <hi>eaſie yoke;</hi> a <hi>yoke</hi> yet <hi>burdenſome</hi> enough in regard of <hi>it ſelf,</hi> but made facile and eaſie by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Grace.</hi> And he that thus loves God with all his heart; though he love him not ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly as the Saints do in heaven; yet in the Judgement, and according to the Reſolution of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> he loves him with that height and perfection of love that the Law does require and look for, the end whereof is onely that we love God as
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:119243:265"/> much as we are able, in order to our <hi>laſt end</hi> and happineſs, and that we may gain that crown which God principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, when he firſt did create us, and impoſed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand upon us. He then that loves God as much as he can, and according to the <hi>utmoſt</hi> of thoſe <hi>abilities</hi> God gives him in this his paſſage to heaven, <hi>fulfills</hi> this commandment, though he loves him not ſo much as another does, to whom God has afforded more Grace, and more ſtrength and more abilities to love him. And he that now loves him with all his heart to day, and ſo obeys the Command, may by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of more Grace be <hi>enabled,</hi> and ſo <hi>obliged</hi> to love God more to morrow, becauſe the Commandment ſtill in force <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely</hi> commands that we love God with all our ſtrength whatſoever it is. And thus he can never know by this <hi>Law</hi> an end of his labour, and an end of his love, till he ſhall come to heaven, where he ſhall love God as Perfectly, as God at firſt intended, when he ſhall arrive at the end, that God aimed at in the enacting of the Law, and preſcribing that inferiour <hi>growing,</hi> ſtill increaſing Love, as a <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>means,</hi> and <hi>way</hi> for the attainment of the other.</p>
               <p>§. 12. And now that this was the meaning of <hi>Aquinas</hi> is very plain from this very reſolution. For he expreſly here declares that the Love in this height of Perfection is not <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible</hi> with our preſent ſtate, but is the perfection of the Saints <hi>in Patriâ,</hi> who love not God by way of <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>obedience,</hi> but by <hi>neceſſity</hi> of their glorified nature, and the <hi>beatificall viſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 13. This will further appear from his anſwers to the three Arguments, in this very Article and Queſtion. For thus he. <hi>Ad primum ergò dicendum, quod ratio illa probat, quod aliquo modo poteſt impleri in hac vitâ licet non perfectè.</hi>

                  <hi>Ad ſecundum dicendum, quod miles qui legitimè pugnat, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet non vincat, non inculpatur, nec poenam meretur, ita etiam qui in viâ hoc praeceptum non implet, nihil contra divinam dile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionem agens, non peccat mortaliter.

Quod quidem contingit tripliciter: uno modo ſic, quod totum cor hominis actualiter ſemper feratur in Deum, &amp; haec eſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio charitatis Patriae, quae non eſt poſſibilis in hac vitâ, in quâ impoſſibile eſt propter humanae vitae infirmitatem ſemper actu cogitare de Deo, &amp; moveri dilectione ad ipſum.

Quod quidem quamvis in plurimas partes diſtingui poſſit, habet tamen aliquas determinatas diſtinctiones, ſecundum determinatas actiones vel ſtudia, ad quae homo perducitur per augmentum, ſicut infantilis at as dicitur antequam habeat uſum rationis, poſtea autem diſtinguitur alius ſtatus hominis; quando jam incipit loqui &amp; ratione uti, iterum tertius ſtatus ejus eſt pubertas, cum jam incipit poſſe generare, &amp; ſic deinde quouſque perveniatur ad perfectum: ita etiam &amp; diverſi gradus charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis diſtinguuntur ſecundum diverſa ſtudia, ad quae homo perdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur per charitatis augmentum.

Secundum autem ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium ſuccedit, ut homo principaliter intendat ad hoc, quod in bono proficiat. Et hoc ſtudium pertinet ad proficientes, qui ad hoc principaliter intendunt, ut in eis charitas per augmentum ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boretur. Tertium autem ſtudium eſt, ut homo ad hoc principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter intendat, ut Deo inhaereat, &amp; eo fruatur, &amp; hoc pertinet ad perfectos, qui cupiunt diſſolvi &amp; eſſe cum Chriſto, ſicuti etiam vidimus in motu corporali, quod primum eſt receſſus â termino, ſecundum autem eſt appropinquatio ad alium terminum, Tertium eſt quies in termino.</hi>

               <p>§. 15. The truth is, <hi>Aquinas</hi> in theſe very places cited by our <hi>Refuter</hi> affirms nothing but what even <hi>Bellarmine</hi> grants, and (if that may content him) Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> alſo will ſubſcribe to even in theſe very places of <hi>Aquinas</hi> that our <hi>Refuter</hi> has here cited. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was too ſubtle, and the <hi>Angelicall</hi> Doctor (as they—call him) had too <hi>Aquiline</hi> a wit, and <hi>eagle-ey'd</hi> Judgement to write palpable contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Indeed this opinion of the Cardinals in this Particular is eaſily reconcileable with that of S. <hi>Austin;</hi> and <hi>Aquinas</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has chalked him out the way. In this <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and the old <hi>Schoolmen</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> let me adde, and the Doctor, and all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> too (that write not for Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Intereſt) agree, and all accord with S. <hi>Austin</hi> and <hi>Bernard,</hi> who ſay the ſame with the Doctor and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and <hi>Aquinas</hi> and the <hi>Schoolmen.</hi> And Truth is venerable and lovely from whoſe mouth ſoever it comes, and a <hi>Prophet</hi> may be fed with that meat a <hi>Raven</hi> brings to him, nor is it therefore <hi>polluted</hi> in the <hi>uſe,</hi> becauſe an <hi>unclean</hi> bird hath touched, or brought it to us.</p>
               <p>§. 16. And therefore now being ſecure of the meaning of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> I ſhall not be very ſollicitous for an anſwer to your next Quotation from that Author.

                  <hi>Dicendum quod Perfectio dicitur in aliquo conſistere dupliciter: uno modo per ſe, &amp; eſſentialiter: alio modo, Secundario &amp; accidentaliter.

Non autem dilectio Dei &amp; Proximi</hi> (this is the paſſage quoted by our Refuter) <hi>cadit ſub praecepto, ſecundum aliquam men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuram ita quod id quod eſt plus ſub Conſilio remaneat, ut pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet ex formâ praecepti, quae perfectionem demonstrat, cum dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, Diliges Dominum Deum tuum ex toto corde tuo (totum enim &amp; perfectum idem ſunt ſecundum Philoſophum</hi> 3. <hi>Phyſ. &amp; cum dicitur, Diliges proximum tuum ſicut teipſum: unuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſque enim ſeipſum maxime diligit.

               <p>§. 18.

This has no bounds or limits, and let a man do here what he can, he can never do enough, becauſe charity is the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Precept,</hi> and no man deliberates how much or how little he ſhould obtain of his <hi>end,</hi> but <hi>ſimply</hi> to obtain it. Now this being not acquira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this life but onely in the next, let us endeavour as much as we can to come to the height of it, yet we ſhall never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. Howſoever fit it was that it ſhould be preſcribed by the commandment, that man might know what to aim at, and that he ſhould labour to attain his laſt end. But then as for that other <hi>Accidentall perfection</hi> of <hi>ſtate,</hi> which is onely <hi>inſtrumentall</hi> and <hi>ſubſervient</hi> to the attainment of the former, that remains under <hi>counſell,</hi> and contains <hi>uncommanded Acts,</hi> and has <hi>uncommanded degrees,</hi> though the <hi>precepts</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> towards God and our neighbours have not.

               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>laſt end</hi> of man conſiſts in that Love that wholy unites man to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this Love is not attainable in this life, becauſe the ſtate of this life admits not poſſibly, that we ſhould ſo love God, as the Saints in heaven do, becauſe they are at the <hi>end,</hi> and we but in the <hi>way</hi> to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That yet this Love though onely attainable in the next life, is propoſed to our deſires and aimes; and commanded we are to endeavour after it, as much as we can, becauſe it is our <hi>Laſt end</hi> and <hi>Perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That the beſt way to attain this Perfection, is to Love God as much as poſſibly we can in this life, and becauſe this Perfection of Love is mans Laſt end, therefore he muſt never deliberate, how much he muſt love God, ſince that agrees not to the <hi>end</hi> but the <hi>means,</hi> and conſequently we muſt think, that we can never love him ſufficiently, or more then enough.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That therefore God commands us in this life by that great precept of Charity, that we love him withall our heart, and ſtrength and endeavour, and that this is the <hi>duty</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> required in that Commandment for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:119243:268"/> of that end that conſiſts in a perfect union with God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That becauſe the <hi>abilities</hi> of men are <hi>diverſe,</hi> and the <hi>callings</hi> and <hi>conditions</hi> of men not alike, and the <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> variable, and mens <hi>endeavours</hi> not alwayes the ſame and equall in the uſe and imployments of thoſe <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,</hi> ſome may more perfectly fulfill the Commandment, and love God more perfectly then others.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That he that attains the <hi>loweſt</hi> degree of divine Charity that conſiſts in avoiding of all <hi>mortall</hi> ſin, has fulfilled this commandment.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That this is the <hi>loweſt</hi> degree of divine <hi>Charity</hi> and the <hi>fullfilling</hi> this commandment.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That there is an <hi>accidentall Perfection</hi> of <hi>ſtate</hi> and <hi>calling</hi> that is <hi>helpfull</hi> and <hi>inſtrumentall</hi> to the attaining the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of divine charity attainable in this life.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That in reſpect of this <hi>ſtate,</hi> there is ſomething left to <hi>Evangelicall counſell,</hi> and <hi>freedome,</hi> and <hi>choice;</hi> and that herein may be a <hi>freewill offering</hi> of love unto God, and in this reſpect a man may do more for his ſake, then God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires by any <hi>Particular</hi> command.</p>
               <p n="11">11. That there is nothing left to <hi>Counſell</hi> and choice in the precepts that <hi>per ſe</hi> and <hi>eſſentialiter</hi> concern the love of God, and our neighbour, but all we can do in them, and our utmoſt endeavour to perform them is under the command.</p>
               <p n="12">12. That an <hi>abſolute ſinleſs perfection,</hi> and an <hi>uninterru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted act</hi> of divine Love is the portion of the <hi>Saints,</hi> and not attainable in this life; and not the <hi>duty</hi> of the <hi>Commandment,</hi> though the <hi>laſt end</hi> and happineſs of the <hi>Man.</hi>

               <p>§. 21. This and much more to this purpoſe may be found in that Author, and not onely in this Queſtion, but alſo in the 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, &amp;c. where he handles the Queſtions of <hi>Charity</hi> at large; and with him agree the antient and the modern <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> as will be evident to any man that ſhall
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:119243:269"/> conſult them. And now how contrary theſe and the like aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are to the deſign of our <hi>Refuter,</hi> I ſhall leave any man to judge, and how much hand over head <hi>Aquinas</hi> his authority was called in by him for his defence.</p>
               <p>§. 22. Nor is he more happy in his next quotation from <hi>Scotus,</hi> which place if conſidered according to the ſcope of the Author fairly anſwers it ſelf.</p>
               <p>§. 23. That ſubtle Doctor there diſputes, <hi>utrum ſit ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua virtus Theologica inclinans ad diligendum Deum ſuper omnia?</hi> He affirms it, l. 3. ſent. diſt. 27. q. unica. In the handling this queſtion, he delivers many profound, and acute, and ſubtle, and yet very uſefull things; but then, according to his manner of writing, he goes not on in an even courſe and method, but ſuddenly leaps from one thing to another, which is the cauſe of his obſcurity to thoſe that read him only <hi>en paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,</hi> with a more quick and tranſeent eye. For uſually ſuch ſublime acute wits that move in the higheſt <hi>orbe,</hi> and ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent a <hi>Sphere,</hi> like the <hi>fixed ſtars,</hi> they caſt forth their light <hi>ſparkling,</hi> and with a kinde of <hi>trembling ſcintillation.</hi> They are wits of a lower <hi>ſtation</hi> that caſt forth their luſtre in one <hi>conſtant,</hi> even, orderly <hi>Ray.</hi> And though theſe, becauſe they are neerer to our apprehenſion, ſeem to have a more pleaſant and far clearer brightneſs, yet the other, though (by reaſon of their height and diſtance from the eye) they ſeem to have a weaker and more inconſtant <hi>trembling ſhine,</hi> and not to give ſo much light in themſelves, are ſtars of a far greater <hi>magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> and brightneſs, though to us they ſeem otherwiſe. But to come to the buſineſs.</p>
               <p>§. 24. That ſubtle Doctor §. 16, 17. whence this quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is borrowed, firſt diſtinguiſhes, and ſayes, God may be loved above all things. 1. <hi>Extenſivè, ita ut plus quis diligat Deum quam omnia alia, &amp; citius vellet omnia alia non eſſe, quam Deum;</hi> that is, as others, God may be loved above all things <hi>Objectivè,</hi> and <hi>Appretiativè.</hi> 2. <hi>Intenſivè, quando</hi>
                  <pb n="497" facs="tcp:119243:269"/> 
                  <hi>quis ex majori affectu vult Deo benè quam alicui alteri.</hi> And then he reſolves that all do agree that God is <hi>extenſively</hi> to be loved above all things, not any thing without God, nor all things together equally and comparable to God.</p>
               <p>§. 25. But then as to the ſecond member he ſayes. Some (meaning <hi>Henriques</hi> and others) do diſtinguiſh and ſay, that one love may be ſaid to be more Intenſe, and exceed an other; firſt, becauſe it is <hi>ferventior ſeu tenerior,</hi> more tender and melting and <hi>effeminately Paſſionate</hi> (a tumult in the affections, ſometimes <hi>enlargeing</hi> the heart with <hi>joy,</hi> and then <hi>ſtrangling</hi> it: for ſome lovers have dyed with it, as the Father at the news of his ſons victories and triumph, and ſometimes <hi>contracting</hi> it, or melting it into <hi>tears.)</hi> Or ſecondly, becauſe it is <hi>fortior, ſive firmior,</hi> of a more ſtrong and <hi>maſculine</hi> temper, and can make a man bold as a Lyon, and reſolve to loſe life and all things, and ſuffer the utmoſt can be inflicted, for the great affection that is in it. And now when <hi>Henriques</hi> and they had reſolved, <hi>quod dilectio Dei,</hi> &amp;c. that we muſt love God above all things, <hi>quoad firmitatem,</hi> with a more <hi>manlike</hi> affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſo that nothing may be able to draw or remove us from the love of Chriſt, yet it is not neceſſary, that we ſhould love God above all things with that <hi>Paſſionateneſs,</hi> and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing, and tenderneſs of affection, becauſe many are found, thus to love the <hi>Creature,</hi> ſuppoſe their <hi>wives</hi> or their <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> more then <hi>God</hi> himſelf, and yet would rather <hi>forſake</hi> wife and children, part with all things then renounce God. And then ſecondly, becauſe if thus both wayes God may be loved above all things, then the commandment <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God,</hi> Deut. 6. might be fullfilled in this life, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to what the <hi>Maſter</hi> and <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Anſelme</hi> determine, <hi>qui nolunt, quod hoc praeceptum ſit nec quod teneamur illud implere, ſed quod implebimus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 26. Againſt this the ſubtle Doctor reſolves that the <hi>maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine</hi> Love, that can make us bold as Lyons, and ready to die for Chriſt is the onely true Love, which is ſeated in the <hi>will,</hi> the other but a Groſſe <hi>materiall</hi> thing a <hi>Paſſion</hi> of the <hi>ſenſitive</hi>
                  <pb n="498" facs="tcp:119243:270"/> appetite. And if any man love more <hi>tenderly</hi> and <hi>paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> then others, and yet leſs <hi>firmly</hi> and ſtrongly and valiantly, this proceeds not from any height and exceſs of the true ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine <hi>intellectuall</hi> love, but from a meer <hi>effeminate</hi> and <hi>paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate</hi> delight, and <hi>melancholy</hi> temper or melting <hi>complexion</hi> and diſpoſition; as ſome <hi>Votaries</hi> and <hi>Recluſes</hi> find many times more raviſhing joyes in their <hi>contemplative</hi> courſe of life, then many more ſolid and well ſetled and grounded Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that an hundred times more readily, and cheerfully can ſuffer <hi>Martyrdome.</hi> A <hi>paſſion</hi> more frequently found in <hi>women</hi> then in <hi>men,</hi> in newly recovered <hi>Penitents</hi> and <hi>Converts</hi> then well grown Chriſtians, <hi>nec dulcedo eſt actus voluntatis elicitus, ſed paſſio quaedam actui retributa, quâ Deus allicit &amp; nutrit parvulos, ne deficiant in viâ.</hi> The fragrancy of the <hi>Apple,</hi> and the perfumes of the <hi>flaggons of wine</hi> wherewith Chriſt comforts his <hi>beloved</hi> when ſhe begins to <hi>ſwoon,</hi> and <hi>faint;</hi> the <hi>milk</hi> for new born <hi>babes,</hi> not the <hi>ſtrong meat</hi> for men.</p>
               <p>§. 27. And then ſecondly he reſolves, God ought to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved above all things as well <hi>intenſively</hi> as <hi>extenſively,</hi> not onely <hi>ſuper omnia alia extenſivè, ſed etiam majori affectu quam ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quod aliud. Et dico majori ſimpliciter, quia ſcil: magis repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnat effectui oppoſito, quia facilius poſſet inclinari ad oppoſitum dilectionis cujuſcunque alterius quam Dei,</hi> that is, if I right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtand him, according to <hi>Chamier, non ſolùm compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratè adres alias, ſed etiam ad nos ipſos,</hi> not onely with a higher affection then that which we beſtow on any thing elſe (for that though the higheſt may be but low in it ſelf) but alſo with an affection as high as we can, becauſe that is moſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to ſin, and moſt repugnant to thoſe effects and Acts that traſh and hinder our love; and is therefore moſt proper for this preſent ſtate, wherein we are more eaſily inclined to love <hi>ſenſuall</hi> objects then <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> the <hi>creature,</hi> then <hi>God;</hi> whence it follows, that we ſhould love God, with ſuch a height of affection, that ſhall enable us and encline us with more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs and eaſe to oppoſe and withſtand the love of any thing elſe, rather then the love of God.</p>
               <pb n="499" facs="tcp:119243:270"/>
               <p> §. 28. And then he adds further, that the reaſon grounded on the authority of <hi>Lumbard</hi> and <hi>Austin</hi> ſignifies nothing <hi>quia pari ratione fuiſſet dandum praeceptum de viſione Dei, non ut impleretur, ſed ut ſciremus quo eſſet tendendum, cujus oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitum ſatis Patet,</hi> and they might have ſaid as well that there ſhould have been a Precept to command us to ſee God face to face, not that it ſhould be fullfilled by us, but that we might know, whether to bend our hopes and aimes.</p>
               <p>§. 29. And now having thus plainly laid down all things, and fully cleared his way he comes to give his reſolution in the words our <hi>Refuter referrs</hi> to. But then I muſt tell the Reader that he has pruned and pared off what makes againſt himſelf, and is neceſſary to underſtand <hi>Scotus</hi> his opinion, and he has brought him as well as he could to the ſize of his own <hi>Bed. Dico igitur quod illud praeceptum extenſivè &amp; intenſivè ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum viam praedictam poteſt impleri in hac vitâ</hi> (which is the full reſolution of the Queſtion, according to the Doctors ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and therefore theſe words were craftily left out by our <hi>Refuter,</hi> leſt he ſhould be diſcovered by his Reader) <hi>ſed non quantum ad omnes conditiones, quae exponuntur per illas additiones ex toto corde, &amp; ex totâ animâ; quia non poteſt eſſe in vitâ tanta recollectio virium ut amotis impedimentis poſſit voluntas tanto conatu ferri quanto poſſet, ſi vires eſſent unitae, &amp; non impeditae, &amp; quoad talem intenſionem actûs expulſis impedimentis &amp; recollectis viribus debet intelligi dictum Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtini, &amp; Magistri, quod praeceptum illud non impletur in viâ, nam pronitas virium inferiorum pro ſtatu isto impedit ſuperiores ab actibus perfectis.</hi> That is, we are bound by the precept to love God above all things extenſively and intenſively, and <hi>ſecundum viam praedictam,</hi> according to the expoſition that we have already given, it may be fullfilled (by Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) in this life; although it cannot be fullfilled according to all thoſe conditions, which ſome expoſitors give of thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions <hi>ex toto corde,</hi> the whole heart, and the whole ſoul, &amp;c. becauſe there cannot be ſo great a recollection of ſtrength, that all impediments being removed, the will may ſo vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:119243:271"/> endeavour, as it might, if the forces of the ſoul were all united, and not hindered: and according to this intenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and fervour of the Acts of love, all impediments being removed, and the ſtrength and forces of the Soul being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected and joyned, muſt the ſaying of <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Lumbard</hi> be underſtood, <hi>That this precept is not fullfilled in this life.</hi> For the proneneſs of the inferiour faculties does for the <hi>preſent ſtate</hi> hinder the ſuperiour from acting to a perfect height. Thus <hi>Scotus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 30. And this is ſo far from ſerving our <hi>Refuters</hi> inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, that <hi>Scotus</hi> directly reſolves the contrary. For certain it is with him that <hi>nulla virtus inclinatur ad actum impoſſibilem habenti,</hi> as he grants in his anſwer to the ſecond Argument §. 21. And therefore he proving that according to S. <hi>Austins</hi> expoſition, it is <hi>ſimply, abſolutely</hi> impoſſible to be obſerved in this life, he muſt of neceſſity reſolve the precept never aimed at it in the obligation. And the Reader will conſider that it is one thing to ſay, <hi>the precept cannot be obſerved ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe conditions ſome give of it,</hi> and another thing to ſay, that <hi>the precept obliges us to obſerve it, according to that, and thoſe conditions ſo given.</hi> This <hi>Scotus</hi> denyes, and onely affirms the former.</p>
               <p>§. 31. And ſo his Scholar and acute <hi>Epitomator</hi> underſtood him, <hi>Nicholaus D'Orbellis</hi> I mean. For thus he in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>§. 32. So alſo <hi>Scotus</hi> his <hi>Scholiaſt, H.

               </p>
               <p>§. 33. And now having found the full meaning of <hi>Scotus</hi> from himſelf and his followers, that beſt ſhould know their Maſters meaning, come we now to compare the Inference of this ſubtle Doctor and our <hi>Refuter</hi> together. <hi>Scotus</hi> he thus concludes. <hi>The Precept binds not us Christians to obſerve it in this life, according to the ſtrictneſs and expoſition of S.</hi> Auſtin <hi>and others, becauſe it is impoſſible to be fulfilled in this life, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe expoſitions.</hi> And now our <hi>Refuter</hi> would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the quite contrary from <hi>Scotus.</hi> Thus, <hi>The ſubtle Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor ſayes this precept cannot thus be obſerved in this life. And therefore according to</hi> Scotus <hi>it obliges us in this ſtrictneſs though it cannot be fullfilled.</hi> And is not this <hi>Refuter</hi> a man of very rare Art, and uncontradictible diſcourſe, that by his all-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Logick is able to conclude one contrary by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other?</p>
               <p>§. 34. And now further to ſhew how much our <hi>Refuter</hi>
                  <pb n="502" facs="tcp:119243:272"/> is miſtaken in the ſenſe of <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Scotus,</hi> I might adde the conſent of the antient and the modern Schoolmen, who all, at leaſt that I have ſeen, in this unanimouſly agree with the two great Maſters, that divide the School between them. But I am quite tyred, and ſo I believe is the Reader. And yet for once I ſhall begg leave of his patience to adde <hi>Durands</hi> reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, becauſe of all the Schoolmen I have read, he does it the moſt fully and diſtinctly, and with the leaſt exception of any.</p>

Sed ſecunda Perfectio fuit in ſtatu innocentiae, quando natura ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buit quicquid habere debuit ſecundum ſtatum illum, &amp; forte plus, quia habuit Justitiam originalem gratuito naturae ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>additam. Ab utraque autem Perfectione deficit Perfectio, quam poteſt ſecundum curſum communem habere natura humana in ſtatu naturae corruptae, quia non potest totaliter vitare, quum incidat in aliquem defectum rationis, ſaltem in aliquod peccatum veniale. Secundum verò hoc in dilectione Dei poteſt attendi du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex perfectio &amp; totalitas: una quando nihil deerit de his quae homo potest expendere in amorem Dei, quin totum ſemper &amp; in actu in dilectione Dei ponat, &amp; haec perfectio ſeu totalitas non ponitur nobis ſub praecepto pro ſtatu viae quia nobis non eſt poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis, ſtatus enim viae non compatitur continuationem in actu, ſed implebitur in Patriâ quando ſemper Beati videbunt Deum, &amp; diligent ipſum, &amp; omnia in ejus dilectionem referent ut in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.

I onely except that paſſage, where he ſayes, We are not bound by this Law to avoid <hi>veniall</hi> ſins, whileſt we are in the way to heaven.

               <p>§. 49. All that is ſaid in thoſe paſſages, or that (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) can be rationally inferred from them, I ſhall briefly ſumm up in theſe <hi>Theoremes.</hi>

                  <pb n="512" facs="tcp:119243:277"/> 1. That the Law of God is the perfect Rule of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Perfection of Righteouſneſs conſiſts in an exact and ſinleſs obedience and conformity to this Rule.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That no man can be Juſtified by this Law according to the Covenant of works that does not thus perfectly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That our Saviour has briefly ſummed up this Perfection of Righteouſneſs, and the whole drift of the Law in theſe two precepts. Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, &amp;c. and our neighbours as our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That he that perfectly keeps theſe has fulfilled all Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That in our lapſed condition we do not, we cannot ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, becauſe <hi>experience,</hi> and <hi>Scripture</hi> teach us, that <hi>in many things we offend all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. That though we do not, we cannot now obſerve it, yet by Faith and Repentance promiſed in the Goſpel, according to the tenor of the ſecond Covenant we ſhall find mercy and grace.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That even <hi>Adam</hi> in innocence, though he had perſevered in that ſtate, could not have arrived to the utmoſt perfection of Love, that is contained in thoſe precepts, becauſe,</p>
               <p n="9">9. This utmoſt perfection of love depends upon a clear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitive knowledge of God.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That here we <hi>walk by Faith,</hi> and hereafter only in heaven we ſhall <hi>walk by fight,</hi> where onely <hi>we ſhall know as we are known.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. That ſince our Love depends upon our knowledge of God, and the more that increaſes, the more will our Love, then ſo much muſt be wanting to the perfection of our Love as is wanting to this knowledge.</p>
               <p n="12">12. That though the utmoſt perfection of Love, that a Saint now <hi>in viâ</hi> and in his <hi>Pilgrimage</hi> to heaven can arrive at, conſiſts, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf teſtifies, in <hi>laying down our lives for the faith and the Brethren,</hi> yet that perfection of love that the Saints now injoy in heaven, and we hope and patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:119243:277"/> look for, far exceeds this, and all elſe that we can pray for, or underſtand. And yet,</p>
               <p n="13">13. This love of the Saints <hi>now made perfect</hi> in heaven is no more, then what is contained in this Precept; it is no more then a love of God with all the heart, &amp;c. Becauſe nothing can be added to that which is perfectly the whole, and if any thing might be added, as yet it were not the whole. And therefore</p>
               <p n="14">14. This of loving God with all the heart is the firſt <hi>great precept</hi> of that <hi>all full all perfect righteouſneſs,</hi> and the <hi>ſecond it like unto it;</hi> and they ſhall both then be <hi>perfectly</hi> fullfilled by us when we come to heaven, where we ſhall <hi>ſee God face to face.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. That this <hi>perfect Rule</hi> of <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> and love, though it cannot be fullfilled in our lapſed eſtate according to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of innocence, much leſs according to the perfection of glory, yet it was impoſed upon us for this end, that we might know what to aim at, and hope for, and endeavour after, as much as we can, and <hi>forgetting what is behind, we might ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly preſs toward the mark ſet before us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. That this love in this utmoſt height and perfection which the Saints now enjoy belongs not to ſinners, but Saints, not to this frail mortall life, but that other which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall.</p>
               <p n="17">17. That the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> that belongs to <hi>believers</hi> in this life, is, that we <hi>ſtrive</hi> againſt ſin, and ſuffer not <hi>ſin</hi> to <hi>reign in our mortall bodies that we ſhould obey it in the lusts thereof.</hi> And therefore</p>
               <p n="18">18. Since this <hi>ſinleſs perfection</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> much leſs that <hi>Perfection of glory</hi> is not poſſible to be attained by us in this our <hi>lapſed</hi> eſtate, God impoſed this impoſſible command on us (who well knew our frailty, and the moment and weight of this Law) not to judge us by it as tranſgreſſors at the laſt day, but onely to humble us, and that every mouth might be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and the world be convinced, that by the works of the Law no fleſh can be juſtified, but that reading our own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and frailties, and miſeries, and ſins, and wants in this
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:119243:278"/> perfect Law, we might <hi>come to the throne of Grace, to find Grace to help in time of need,</hi> from him in that day, who then <hi>not by works of righteouſneſs which we have wrought, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his mercy muſt, and will ſave us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19. That God ſaw it reaſonable, even in this <hi>lapſed</hi> eſtate, to preſcribe us this rule of Perfection, though no man can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto it, that we might know the end of our race, and the crown and reward of our endeavours, which awaits us at the end of the Goale, and to what perfection of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and holyneſs we ſhould aim at, and endeavour, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after, and conſider not what we yet have attained, and then lazily ſit down, as if we had done ſufficiently, but ſtill look forward, and conſider what yet we want.</p>
               <p n="20">20. That he is the greateſt proficient in this School of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and has arrived higheſt to it, that conſidering the excellency of the mark ſet before us, does humbly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge how much he is ſhort of it, and ſtill labours to go higher, ſo long as he continues in the race and way to it, ſo long as he is a ſtranger and <hi>Pilgrim on earth</hi> and a traveller toward heaven.</p>
               <p>§. 50. This is the utmoſt thoſe two <hi>Fathers</hi> drive at, and I deſire our <hi>Refuter</hi> to ſit down, and conſider, whether he can poſſibly make more of them then here I have done. And if this will content him, I ſhall here ſubſcribe to the truth of every <hi>Theoreme,</hi> and ſo will the Doctor. Indeed there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here, but what is fully contained in the Doctors wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, eſpecially in the Practicall Catechiſm, as the Reader will ſoon perceive, if he be pleaſed onely to review the places al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready quoted. And if <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or any <hi>Papist</hi> elſe, deny the truth of any one of theſe, or maintain any thing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to them, I ſhall lend our <hi>Refuter</hi> my helping hand, if he will accept of ſuch poor aſſiſtance, to oppoſe him in his errours.</p>
               <p>§. 51. But then for all that I muſt tell him, that he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to prove, that S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> or <hi>Bernard</hi> ever imagined
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:119243:278"/> or determined, that this Law of <hi>Perfect</hi> righteouſneſs and love, according to the ſtrictneſs of the <hi>Covenant of works,</hi> much leſs according to the <hi>Perfection of Glory,</hi> is the <hi>rule</hi> whereby God will <hi>Judge</hi> or <hi>abſolve believers</hi> at the latter day, becauſe they <hi>are not under the Law but under Grace;</hi> and the Perfection of <hi>Glory</hi> was even in <hi>Paradiſe</hi> impoſſible to <hi>Adam;</hi> abſolutely, ſimply impoſſible; and by Gods <hi>penall</hi> decree, the ſinleſs perfection of righteouſneſs in Innocence, is now accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods <hi>ordinary</hi> power and grace impoſſible to <hi>believers,</hi> whilſt they are yet in the <hi>way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 52. Indeed plain it is, that both S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Bernard</hi> determine the contrary; they ſay in expreſs terms that here in this life we are bound not to ſuffer ſin to <hi>reign,</hi> that we be <note place="margin">Vib. Auguſt. de perfect. Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae contra Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtium per tot.</note> humble, and repent, and rely on Gods mercy, and labour as much as poſſibly we can, to preſs towards the mark, to be as holy as we can; and this is all, they ſay, is required of us to <hi>Justification.</hi> And if they ſpeak that more is required, it is onely to let us know our <hi>last hopes,</hi> and <hi>laſt end,</hi> and <hi>laſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> beyond which we cannot go, and after which we ſhould <hi>pant,</hi> and <hi>long for, as the Hart does after the water-brooks.</hi> They tell us it is the <hi>Crown</hi> at the end of the <hi>Goal</hi> which we muſt run for, and not the <hi>race</hi> it ſelf to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven. For otherwiſe they muſt ſay that <hi>believers</hi> are now under the <hi>Law,</hi> as well as <hi>Adam</hi> was, and not under <hi>Grace,</hi> which is directly contrary to the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and thoſe very writings from whence theſe paſſages are cited, and the whole tenor of their works. And therefore all things being ſo fair and clear it would be too great a torment to the Reader to trouble him with any other places from thoſe <hi>Fathers</hi> to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>§. 53. And now being come to the top of the Hill, let us caſt our eyes back, and review our walk, and well conſider how we are gon on in our way,</p>
               <p>Firſt then, plain it is that both the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Schoolmen</hi> quoted by our <hi>Refuter</hi> againſt the Doctor, ſpeak of an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:119243:279"/> ſinleſs perfection, and more, a freedome from ſin, and a Love as large as heaven it ſelf, and the fruition of God can afford, when they ſay the Commandment cannot to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection be fulfilled in this life.</p>
               <p>Secondly as plain it is, that the Schoolmen in their diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of charity, as well <hi>Aquinas</hi> and his Scholars in <hi>ſecunda ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundae,</hi> and the Maſter of the Sentences in his third book, and the 27. Diſtinction &amp;c. generally ſpeak of the <hi>habit</hi> of <hi>divine Charity,</hi> whereby we are <hi>enabled</hi> to fullfill Gods command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and little or nothing of the <hi>Acts</hi> of this love, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when they expound theſe two great commandments of <hi>Charity;</hi> and particularly they do ſo even in theſe very places from whence our <hi>Refuters</hi> quotations are taken.</p>
               <p>§. 54. Now I ſhall deſire the Reader to conſider how this nothing at all concerns the Doctor, and the <hi>Question</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate between him and his adverſary.</p>
               <p>For, 1. The Queſtion is concerning the degree and graduall intenſion of the <hi>Acts,</hi> not the <hi>habit</hi> of divine Charity, and now our <hi>Refuters</hi> proofs all concern the latter, and not the former, which was never in debate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Queſtion betwixt the <hi>Refuter</hi> and the Doctor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns not the <hi>Acts</hi> of that high tranſcendent Love, which is immediately planted upon God, but onely the <hi>Acts</hi> of charity as generally taken for the <hi>fruits</hi> and <hi>effects,</hi> and <hi>demonſtrations</hi> of this Love immediately planted on God, ſuch as are the <hi>Acts</hi> of mercy, and Almſ-giving, zeal, and fervour in Prayer, and the like, and his proofs belong nothing to this at all, but the former, if they concern that.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Doctor oftentimes expreſly declares in his anſwer to M. <hi>Cawdrey,</hi> written in defence of the Treatiſe of <hi>Will-worſhip,</hi> which our <hi>Refuter</hi> now undertakes to overthrow, that it is not that <hi>abſolute ſinleſs perfection</hi> that he means or ſpeaks of, when he ſayes it conſiſts in a <hi>latitude,</hi> and has <hi>degrees,</hi> but onely of the ſincerity of this or that <hi>particular Act of virtue or grace,</hi> when he ſayes it conſiſts in a latitude and has degrees, and may be fullfilled by Gods grace, though a man arrive not
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:119243:279"/> to an abſolute ſinleſs perfection, and exactly keep not all the Commandments of God, according to the ſtrictneſs of the Law. And yet our <hi>Refuters</hi> arguments and Quotations do all belong to the former, and little or nothing concern the latter, alone in debate.</p>
               <p>§. 55. And therefore, if I thought I might any wayes gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie our <hi>Refuter,</hi> I ſhall grant him all he deſires, and ſo eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleads for, and yet undertake to make good the Doctors ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument and Poſition.</p>
               <p>§. 56. And yet for all that our <hi>Refuter</hi> is confident that (as if the Doctors Treatiſe of <hi>will-worſhip</hi> were like <hi>Archime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> his <hi>ſphere</hi> though curious to the eye, and made with great and ſubtle Art, yet the frame was but of <hi>Glaſs)</hi> he has ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly daſhed this excellent compoſure to pieces with this ſingle blow; and that though M. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> had failed, yet now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was left to ſecure the Doctor from his <hi>all-conquering</hi> ſword of diſcourſe, but <hi>Bellarmines</hi> ſhield and Buckler for his laſt refuge and defence. And therefore thus gravely he beſpeaks the Doctor, and with the mercy of a Conquerour.</p>

               <p>§. 5. 57. Well Sir, you have ſaid; but how well adviſedly I ſhall leave the Reader to conſider. For though what is
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:119243:280"/> 
                  <hi>known</hi> or <hi>unknown</hi> to you, I well <hi>know</hi> not, yet this I <hi>know,</hi> that your <hi>knowledge</hi> and skill in <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Aquinas</hi> is not very great, and that no man of Ingenuity and Judgement, that had ever read the places, either in <hi>Aquinas</hi> or <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> would have ſuffered ſuch a paſſage to drop from his pen. For what is the <hi>Relative</hi> to this <hi>(They)</hi> in this paſſage? Is it not plain, that it refers to the places of <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Scotus?</hi> you name indeed <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Bernard,</hi> but you cite them not atall. And will not now any man that reads this paſſage againſt the Doctor, conclude, that this was a trick of <hi>Bellarmines,</hi> on purpoſe invented to decline the force of theſe Quotations of <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Scotus</hi> brought againſt him by <hi>Chamier?</hi> What elſe can be the meaning of it?

                           <p>Thirdly, you ſeem in the latter end of Section the 39. to intimate, that in the time of Chriſts Agony there was more occaſion for the heightning of his Love of God, then there was at other times. What you mean by theſe occaſions of heightning Chriſts Love of God that you intimate, I will not undertake to gueſs, but this I am ſure of, that at all other times, he had ſufficient cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, grounds and motives to induce him to Love God with as heightned degrees of Actuall Love as the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature could reach unto; he enjoyed the beatifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call viſion, a clear, evident, and intuitive knowledge of the divine eſſence, that had in it all the fullneſs of goodneſs, and ſo was an object infinitely lovely and amiable: Now ſuch an object thus known, thus ſeen, challengeth ſuch a meaſure of actuall Love, as that it leaveth no place for a further and higher degree. The <hi>Thomiſts</hi> generally maintain that this moſt intenſe Love of God is a naturall and neceſſary ſequele of the beatificall viſion, neceſſary <hi>quoad exercitium,</hi> as well as <hi>quoad ſpecificationem actus;</hi> now that which works naturally and neceſſarily, works as vehemently and forcibly as it can, <hi>omne agens de neceſſitate, neceſſario agit uſque ad ultimum potentiae ſuae;</hi> therefore the inward Acts of Chriſts Love of God were alwayes as ardent, and fervent as he could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them, and therefore ſome were not more intenſe then others: for if we ſpeak of a liberty of indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and indetermination, he had no more liberty towards the intenſion of the inward Acts of his Love, then he had towards the Acts themſelves.</p>

               <p> §. 2. You have ſaid, Sir, but I muſt tell you that though this argument is <hi>wire-drawn</hi> to the utmoſt length, yet there is nothing proved all this while, that is in debate betwixt you and your adverſary. You need not have ſpent ſo much time in proving, that Chriſt as <hi>Comprehenſor</hi> did love God to the utmoſt height poſſible. It ſhould have been granted you for asking. It is a known undoubted truth in the Schools, a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> that <hi>de congruo</hi> follows from the Hypoſtaticall union, and therefore queſtioned by none, but the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and thoſe that deny the divinity of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>§. 3. But I ſee by experience, that Gold, the moſt ſolid, moſt ponderous of Metalls, may be beaten ſo thin, that it may be moved with a <hi>breath,</hi> and broken with a <hi>touch.</hi> And our <hi>Refuter</hi> is ſo unhappy, as to weaken an undoubted truth by his overmuch proving it. For if the inward <hi>Acts</hi> of Chriſts love were alwayes at the utmoſt height, becauſe this moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe love is a <hi>naturall</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> ſequele of the <hi>Beatificall viſion,</hi> then it neceſſarily follows, if his love were alwayes thus intenſe, that then he alwayes enjoyned the <hi>Beatificall viſion,</hi> the ſole and neceſſary cauſe of ſuch a love. For it is an undoubted <hi>Maxime,</hi> That <hi>Poſitis aut ſublatis effectu &amp; cauſâ neceſſariis, ponuntur &amp; tolluntur cauſa &amp; effectus.</hi> And if ſo, what then ſhall we ſay to the Author of a <hi>mixture of Scholaſticall divinity with Practicall,</hi> Henry Jeanes <hi>of Ched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoy?</hi> For ſayes he not expreſly, <hi>That it is not to be denyed,</hi>

                  <hi>but that by ſpeciall diſpenſation, there was ſome restraint of the influence of this happineſs or beatificall viſion, in the whole courſe of his humiliation, and Particularly in the time of his dolefull Paſſien?</hi> And now if his <hi>fervour</hi> of love, were a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall</hi> iſſue of the <hi>beatificall viſion,</hi> it will neceſſarily follow that as that his happineſs, and clear intuitive ſight of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence was <hi>restrained,</hi> ſo the <hi>fervour</hi> of his love was <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably</hi> abated alſo.</p>
               <p>§. 4. But not to trouble our ſelves much with any contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of our <hi>Refuter,</hi> I ſuppoſe he meant well; whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:119243:282"/> he ſayes. It was truly ſaid by Saint <hi>Leo,</hi> and all Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has approved it, that at the time of our Saviours Paſſion, <hi>Non diſſolvit unionem, ſed ſubtraxit viſionem.</hi> And hence it comes to paſs that we read of our Saviours ſaying, <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowfull unto death,</hi> and his crying upon the Croſs, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> And I believe our <hi>Refuter</hi> is not ignorant what M. <hi>Calvin</hi> has ſaid of that expoſtulation.</p>
               <p>§ 5. And why then might not this be a fit <hi>ſeaſon</hi> for the heightning of the Ardency of our Saviours zeal and devotion, when he prayed for the reſtoring of thoſe comforts and Joys that flowed from the Influence of the <hi>Beatificall viſion,</hi> which now was <hi>restrained?</hi> The more comfort and happineſs he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly enjoyed from this <hi>clear intuitive knowledge,</hi> the more earneſtly now, without doubt, he would long for it. And had not now our bleſſed Saviour in this extremity, and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Paſſion, and ſufferings, when the <hi>manhood</hi> was left <hi>naked,</hi> without any <hi>beams</hi> of <hi>comfort</hi> ſtreaming from the <hi>Godhead,</hi> which now by ſpeciall diſpenſation, our <hi>Refuter</hi> grants, (as indeed it is moſt evident from Scripture alſo) were <hi>reſtrained,</hi> had not now I ſay our bleſſed Saviour <hi>occaſion</hi> enough for the heightning of his <hi>fervour</hi> in prayer, had he not now <hi>grounds</hi> and <hi>motives</hi> ſufficient to induce him to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his ardency, and zeale, when he prayes for the <hi>reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of thoſe <hi>joyes?</hi> For who ſo ardently longs for a <hi>Repoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion</hi> of happineſs, as he that has once been ſatisfied with the raviſhing contentments of it? The loſs of thoſe comforts, which <hi>David</hi> formerly enjoyed, was it, that made him ſo earneſtly cry out, Pſal. 51. 12. <hi>Reſtore unto me the joy of thy Salvation, and uphold me with thy free Spirit: Make me to hear joy and gladneſs, that the bones which thou haſt broken may rejoyce.</hi> The Iron that has once been touched with the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and enjoyed the benefit and ſweetneſs of that <hi>magnetick Love,</hi> and Influence, does more earneſtly deſire and move ſtronger to a <hi>Re-union</hi> with that Loadſtone, then it did before the <hi>touching.</hi> And this is abundantly ſufficient to demonſtrate
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:119243:283"/> the utmoſt of the Doctors pretences in his <hi>Ectenesteron,</hi> who there undertakes onely to ſhew that the fervency of Chriſts zeale and devotion in <hi>Prayer</hi> was in his <hi>Agony</hi> encreaſed. But then becauſe it is an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>devotion,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Charity</hi> and love to God, as that is <hi>commonly</hi> taken in the Scripture (of which Love alone does the Doctor ſpeak,) and ſo is not that <hi>Love,</hi> that high <hi>tranſcendent</hi> Love, which flowed from the <hi>Beatificall viſion,</hi> which our Saviour, as <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſor,</hi> enjoyed (and that which our <hi>Refuter</hi> here ſpeaks of) plain it is that by this Argument (if all were granted) he oppoſes not the Doctor.</p>
               <p>§. 6. But then this is not onely ſufficient to <hi>acquit</hi> the Doctor, but alſo to <hi>deſtroy</hi> all the <hi>truth</hi> in his Argument. For if now, eſpecially in the time of our Saviours dolefull <hi>paſſion,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> and <hi>beatificall viſion</hi> were <hi>reſtrained,</hi> then it evidently follows that now at leaſt there was more <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion</hi> then formerly even for the heightning of his love of God, as that is <hi>properly</hi> taken. For our Love of neceſſity muſt bear a <hi>proportion</hi> and <hi>correſpondence</hi> to our <hi>knowledge,</hi> and therefore we ſhall love more, infinitely more, when we ſee God <hi>face to face,</hi> then now poſſibly we can, when we ſee him onely <hi>in aenigmate, in ſpeculo, by Faith as in a glaſs darkly.</hi> And conſequently ſo muſt it be with our Saviours love alſo, at leaſt during this reſtraint. And therefore (to grant to our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer</hi> what he adds in that Treatiſe immediately after) <hi>though ſurely it ſeems very improbable, and no wayes ſortable unto the ſtate of Chriſts bleſſedneſs, for his grace and holineſs, the image of God in him</hi> (his love of God in the <hi>habit) to be lyable unto perpetuall motion, and augmentation,</hi> yet even there he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf expreſly grants, that <hi>his Actuall grace and wiſdome, and conſequently</hi> his <hi>acts</hi> of divine love did <hi>encreaſe,</hi> and <hi>gradually</hi> differ: and if he ſhould here deny it, this argument we have urged from his own <hi>conceſſions,</hi> will neceſſarily enforce it.</p>
               <p>§. 7. The truth is he met with a common received truth, but for want of <hi>skill</hi> and a <hi>right underſtanding</hi> of the <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>

From all which well conſidered (if already we have not given a full and ſatisfactory anſwer to all the <hi>pretences</hi> of this diſcourſe of our <hi>Refuter)</hi> it will evidently appear; that though Chriſt as <hi>Comprehenſor</hi> in the ſuperiour Part of his ſoul, had alwayes a clear <hi>intuitive knowledge</hi> of the divine <hi>Eſſence</hi> and a <hi>naturall</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> love of God, thus clearly known, (which was alwayes at the utmoſt height, ſtill one and the ſame uninterrupted <hi>Act,</hi> becauſe ſimply neceſſary) yet this <hi>beatifick knowledge,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of God was ſo <hi>mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly</hi> ordered, that it hindred not, nor any wayes altered the <hi>Acts</hi> and operations of the <hi>inferiour faculties</hi> of his ſoul, nor changed the <hi>mannner</hi> of working of thoſe his <hi>infuſed</hi> gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whether of <hi>knowledge</hi> or <hi>love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or his <hi>neighbours,</hi> or the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of any other <hi>virtues</hi> and <hi>graces,</hi> neceſſary for him in the ſtate of a <hi>viator.</hi> To all which as in that ſtate he had a true and <hi>proper</hi> freedome, ſo he did truly <hi>merit</hi> by the free ezerciſe of them. And as the happineſs he enjoyed in this <hi>ſuperiour faculty</hi> of his ſoul, as <hi>Comprehenſor,</hi> did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that at the time of his <hi>Paſſion,</hi> his ſoul, in the <hi>infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour</hi> parts, was <hi>ſorrowfull unto death,</hi> and had no comfort from thoſe <hi>ſupernaturall</hi> joyes in the <hi>ſuperiour,</hi> which now by <hi>ſpeciall providence</hi> and diſpenſation were ſuſpended: ſo this <hi>naturall</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> fulneſs of his <hi>beafitick Love</hi> nothing hindered, but that there might be a <hi>graduall</hi> difference in
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:119243:285"/> the <hi>Acts</hi> and exerciſe of his <hi>infuſed</hi> love of <hi>God,</hi> or at leaſt in the <hi>Acts</hi> of love towards us his <hi>neighbours,</hi> and the <hi>Acts</hi> of other virtues and graces. All which <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,</hi> and <hi>zeal</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>love</hi> to his <hi>neighbours,</hi> and <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to Gods commands, in the exerciſe of all other <hi>virtues</hi> and graces, his will did <hi>freely</hi> perform in that way, that was proper and moſt agreeable to the ſtate of a <hi>viator.</hi> And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſince every man in the exerciſe of theſe virtues and graces is bound to exerciſe them <hi>quoad debitas circumſtantias,</hi> and ſince we have clearly ſhewed already, that the ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and fervency is not required in every <hi>Act,</hi> it evidently follows, that, notwithſtanding this ſuperlative height and fervour in this his <hi>Actuall</hi> Love, as <hi>Comprehenſor,</hi> yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the other <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> and holy <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> and <hi>virtue</hi> (which he exerciſed <hi>freely</hi> as <hi>viator)</hi> there might be a <hi>graduall</hi> difference of fervour and intenſneſs, according as the preſent exigence required. And therefore if it appear (as it has already) that Chriſt in his bloody Agony had now greater <hi>occaſion</hi> for the heightning of his <hi>Fervour</hi> in <hi>Prayer,</hi> then formerly, it alſo as cleerly follows, that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>de facto</hi> he did pray <hi>more earneſtly,</hi> then at other times, but it was his <hi>duty</hi> to do ſo. And here for avoiding of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells,</hi> I muſt mind our <hi>Refuter</hi> of <hi>Calvins</hi> obſervation for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly noted, that a time of <hi>affliction</hi> is a <hi>ſeaſon</hi> for more then <hi>ordinary ſervency</hi> in Prayer, and that God then <hi>calls</hi> for it, and Chriſt has inſtructed us in this leſſon by his own <hi>Practiſe</hi> and <hi>example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 10. And therefore be it now granted to our <hi>Refuter,</hi> that Chriſt, during his abode upon earth, and the dayes of his fleſh, enjoyed the <hi>beatificall viſion,</hi> and by reaſon of that clear <hi>intuitive</hi> knowledge loved God to the utmoſt height poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; yet what will he thence conclude? will it follow, does he think, that therefore in <hi>every reſpect,</hi> and as <hi>viator</hi> alſo he ſo loved him? Or at leaſt that he loved us, his <hi>neighbours</hi> ſo too, and that as neceſſary he did exerciſe all the other <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>virtues</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Obedience?</hi> If
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:119243:285"/> ſo, I muſt ask him, how then could <hi>Chriſt</hi> ever be <hi>in ſtatu me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendi,</hi> and even whileſt he was <hi>viator,</hi> be the <hi>meritorious cauſe</hi> and <hi>Authour of ſalvation to all them that obey him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 11. I muſt therefore mind him, that this his long Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is no other then the old <hi>fallacy</hi> and Sophiſm <hi>à Dicto ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum quid ad dictum ſimpliciter.</hi> Thus, Becauſe Chriſt as <hi>Comprehenſor</hi> loved God alwayes at one utmoſt height, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as <hi>viator</hi> in every <hi>Act</hi> of divine <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>devotion</hi> and <hi>love</hi> to us his <hi>neighbours,</hi> and in every <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> he did ſo too; which how abſurd and falſe it is, will appear at firſt ſight I doubt not, even to our <hi>Refuter</hi> himſelf. And therefore I deny the <hi>ſequele</hi> of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. For though the <hi>Antecedent</hi> be true, that Chriſt as <hi>Comprehenſor</hi> ſo loved, yet the <hi>Conſequence</hi> is falſe and falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, that therefore as <hi>viator</hi> he did ſo too. And therefore the Doctors <hi>Poſition</hi> of the <hi>Contrary</hi> to the <hi>Conſequent</hi> muſt needs be true, That the <hi>Acts</hi> of Chriſts Love or holy Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, exerciſed by him as <hi>viator,</hi> might be gradually different in fervour, notwithſtanding our <hi>Refuters Antecedent</hi> be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which is all the <hi>medium</hi> he here brings to confute the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors aſſertion. And now let me ask our <hi>Refuter,</hi> ſuppoſe I ſhould ſay, If the <hi>Aethiop</hi> have white teeth, therefore the <hi>Aethiop</hi> is white, would he not ſay it was a ridiculous <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſme, à dicto ſecundum quid ad dictum ſimpliciter?</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he would thus anſwer, and he would anſwer truly. And yet ſuch is his <hi>Argumentation</hi> here againſt the Doctor, and therefore ſo muſt be anſwered.</p>
               <p>§. 12. But this is not all the miſadventure of our <hi>Refuters</hi> diſcourſe. In this 1. He betrayes very much ignorance and want of knowledge of thoſe <hi>Logicall termes</hi> of <hi>Art</hi> which he uſes; and 2. His own diſcourſe <hi>contradicts</hi> its ſelf; and 3. He ſpeaks moſt apparent <hi>tautologies,</hi> all unpardonable faults in one that profeſſes himſelf to write in a <hi>ſcholaſticall way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 13. For firſt, he very inartificially confounds theſe terms,
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:119243:286"/> 
                  <hi>Occaſion, grounds,</hi> and <hi>Motives,</hi> and <hi>Cauſes.</hi> For thus he ſayes, <hi>What you mean by theſe</hi> Occaſions <hi>of heightning Chriſts Love of God, that you intimate, I ſhall not undertake to gueſſe; but this I am ſure of, that at all other times he had ſufficient</hi> Cauſes, Grounds <hi>and</hi> Motives <hi>to induce him to love God with as heightned degrees of Actuall Love, as the humane nature could reach unto, he enjoyed the beatificall viſion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>§. 14. For the <hi>beatificall viſion</hi> was a <hi>neceſſary Cauſe</hi> of this moſt heightned <hi>Actuall</hi> Love: and <hi>ſuch an Object as God is, thus known, challengeth</hi> (as himſelf ſpeaks) <hi>ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Actuall Love, as that it leaveth no place for a further degree.</hi> And he adds, <hi>The Thomiſts generally maintain, that this moſt intenſe love of God is a Naturall and Neceſſary ſequele of the beatificall viſion, Neceſſary</hi> quoad exercitium, <hi>as well as</hi> quoad ſpecificationem actus. And it ſeems, he is of their opinion. For from hence he argues; <hi>Now that which works Naturally and Neceſſarily works as vehemently and forceably as it can.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 15. But then <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> to induce one to Love are not <hi>Neceſſary</hi> cauſes of Love. They are onely <hi>ſuaſoria,</hi> moral perſwaſions, and <hi>rationall</hi> inducements to perſwade a man, that has a <hi>proper freedome</hi> and <hi>liberty of indifferency and indetermination</hi> of the <hi>will</hi> (which yet expreſly in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe the <hi>Refuter</hi> denyes of Chriſt, either to the <hi>Acts</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi> of divine Love, of which he ſpeaks) either to forſake that which he already embraces, or to follow that, which now he neglects, or elſe to heighten and quicken him, either in his flight, or embrace of any object, he declines, or perſues.</p>
               <p>§. 16. And then as for the term <hi>(Occaſion),</hi> that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but an <hi>Opportunity</hi> and advantage of <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place</hi> that has ſome kind of virtue to excite the <hi>Agent</hi> to work at this inſtant, when now all impediments ſeem to be taken off. This is no other then a kind of <hi>Cauſa ſine quâ non,</hi> an <hi>acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall</hi>
                  <pb n="531" facs="tcp:119243:286"/> thing, that not alwayes happens, and becauſe it ſtayes not (for<hi>—poſt eſt occaſio calva,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>§. 16. And therefore though Chriſt, as <hi>Comprehenſor,</hi> had ſufficient <hi>cauſe</hi> alwayes to Love God at the utmoſt height poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the humane nature, to wit, a clear <hi>intuitive knowledge</hi> of the <hi>divine Eſſence,</hi> yet he had no more <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> to this love, then he had <hi>occaſions,</hi> becauſe he alwayes loved <hi>naturally</hi> and <hi>neceſſarily</hi> to the utmoſt height, and it was impoſſible for him to do otherwiſe. Will any man read a <hi>Morall</hi> Lecture of <hi>Perſuaſion</hi> to excite a <hi>Stone</hi> to move down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or labour by <hi>Grounds</hi> and Motives to induce the <hi>Fire</hi> to burn? A pair of <hi>bellowes</hi> are worth all the <hi>Suaſories</hi> in <hi>Seneca,</hi> or the <hi>Declamations</hi> of <hi>Quintilian.</hi> The <hi>glorified Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> have <hi>Cauſe</hi> ſufficient to love God, the <hi>bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificall viſion,</hi> and therefore as they need no <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> to induce them to love God, ſo they have none uſed to them in heaven, becauſe there they <hi>naturally</hi> and <hi>neceſſarily</hi> love God, and it is a part of their happineſs and a neceſſary fruit of their glorified natures to do ſo. <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> as well as <hi>Occaſions,</hi> are proper onely to thoſe that are <hi>in viâ,</hi>
                  <pb n="532" facs="tcp:119243:287"/> that are in the <hi>way</hi> to heaven, to ſtirr up their ſpirits, and flagging dull Motions, and quicken them in the Race, as alſo to dehort them from thoſe things, that may be an occaſion ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their fall, or ſlow motion.</p>
               <p>§. 17. But then this nothing hinders, but, as conſidered in the ſtate of <hi>a viator,</hi> he might have both <hi>Occaſions</hi> to heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>ardency</hi> in <hi>Prayer,</hi> (as the Doctor affirms he had, and we have already demonſtrated the Truth of his aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſhall by and by further clear it) and alſo <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> to ſtrengthen and confirm him in his <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>magnanimity</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> in the midſt of his bitter agony. For we have already obſerved from the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> and beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, that the <hi>Angell</hi> that was ſent to <hi>Comfort</hi> our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, and <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> him in his bitter Agony, did it by <hi>Morall Arguments</hi> and <hi>Suaſories,</hi> and <hi>Rationall Grounds</hi> and <hi>Motives,</hi> Remonſtrating him the tranſcendency of his Love to Mankind, and the Glory of the Acqueſt, his obedience to God his Father, and the Crown and Reward laid up for him; The Advancement of the honour of Gods Mercy, and the magnifying his Name in the ſalvation of mankind, and the like.</p>
               <p>§. 18. But then ſecondly, by this <hi>Confuſion</hi> he falls upon the Rock of palpable <hi>contradiction,</hi> and one part of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe confutes the other. For if Chriſt had alwayes ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Cauſes, Grounds</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> to induce him to love God, &amp;c. then he did not love him <hi>naturally</hi> and <hi>neceſſarily;</hi> as he ſayes he did: Or elſe if he alwayes loved God to the utmoſt height <hi>naturally</hi> and <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> then he had not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſufficient <hi>Cauſes, Grounds</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> to induce him to love God to the utmoſt height. For <hi>Cauſes, Grounds</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> to love ſuppoſe an abſolute <hi>freedome</hi> and liberty of <hi>indetermination</hi> and <hi>indifferency</hi> to love, which is perfectly contrary to an <hi>abſolute neceſſity</hi> of loving, and therefore <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſſible</hi> with it. Let him chuſe which part he will, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the Rock if he can.</p>
               <pb n="533" facs="tcp:119243:287"/>
               <p> §. 19. If he ſayes that Chriſt as <hi>viator</hi> had ſufficient <hi>cauſes grounds</hi> and <hi>motives</hi> to induce him to love God to the utmoſt height, becauſe as <hi>Comprehenſor</hi> he enjoyed the <hi>beatificall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> and <hi>naturally</hi> loved him; I deny his <hi>ſequele;</hi> becauſe then it would alſo follow, that he had ſufficient <hi>cauſes, grounds,</hi> and <hi>motives</hi> to love God in that height, which was <hi>incompoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> with his ſtate of <hi>viator,</hi> to wit, with as heightned <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Actuall</hi> love, as the humane nature could reach to, which is the ſtate of a <hi>Comprehenſor;</hi> and conſequently implyes a kind of <hi>contradiction in adjecto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 20. And then thirdly he not onely ſpeaks <hi>contradictions,</hi> but palpable <hi>Tautologies.</hi> 
                  <q>For he ſayes <hi>Chriſt naturally and neceſſarily loved God to the utmost height of Actuall Love,</hi> and then adds in the cloſe by way of proof; <hi>For if we ſpeak of a liberty of indifferency and indetermination, he had no more liberty towards the intenſion of the inward Acts of his Love, than he had towards the Acts themſelves.</hi>
                  </q> It is juſt, as if I ſhould affirm, the <hi>Aethiops</hi> skin to be black, and then adde for a further confirmation; For if we talk of any colour in his skin that was <hi>diſgregative</hi> of the ſight, he had none, which were a moſt ridiculous <hi>tautologicall</hi> argumentation, and proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>idem per idem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 21. And therefore having now ſhewed the weakneſs, and very inartificiall proceeding of our <hi>Refuters</hi> diſcourſe, I am at leaſure to tell him, what were the <hi>occaſions</hi> of height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our Saviours Love of God, at the time of his Paſſion, more then he had at other times, which the Doctor intimates, and our <hi>Refuter</hi> (out of his great <hi>Scholaſticall modesty,</hi> and profound <hi>Christian humility</hi> and tenderneſs to our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours <hi>honour,</hi> I ſuppoſe he means) <hi>will not undertake to gueſs at.</hi> But firſt I will tell him, what Love it was the Doctor means, that ſo all occaſions of <hi>Cavill</hi> may be avoided.</p>
               <p>§. 22. The Schools ordinarily diſtinguiſh of a twofold Love of God; one they call <hi>Amor Concupiſcentiae,</hi> or <hi>Amor deſiderii.</hi> The other they call <hi>Amor Amicitiae</hi> or <hi>Amor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placentiae.</hi>
                  <pb n="534" facs="tcp:119243:288"/> The firſt is a Love of God for the <hi>benefits</hi> we hope, and are to receive from him; and ariſes out of an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ſenſibleneſs of thoſe <hi>wants</hi> and <hi>needs,</hi> that he alone is able to ſupply.

He is my defence, Pſal.</hi> 18. 1. <hi>And in another place, Becauſe he heard my voyce: yet ſeeing</hi> David <hi>did not Love God onely or chiefly for his benefits, his love was not properly mercenary, but true though not Perfect.</hi> Thus far this moſt excellent Biſhop, whoſe words I have made uſe of, as Jewels and ornaments to this diſcourſe, and becauſe I think it impoſſible (to me I am ſure) to expreſs it better.</p>
               <p>§. 23. Now Chriſt being <hi>made like to us in all things, ſin onely excepted,</hi> he muſt alſo have in him this <hi>naturall</hi> love of God for his benefits and protection, and aſſiſtance, that he had, and might have from him; and the <hi>Schools</hi> do reſolve ſo. For it was in its ſelf <hi>naturall,</hi> and therefore not ſinfull; and his preſent ſlate of a <hi>viator</hi> in the dayes of his fleſh requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it. For though <hi>the Foxes have holes, and the birds of the Air have neſts; yet the ſon of man had not where to lay his head.</hi> He was truly <hi>vir deſideriorum, a man of deſires,</hi> as well as <hi>a man of ſorrows.</hi> This, as it was <hi>naturall</hi> to the fleſh, and proper to him in the ſtate of a <hi>viator,</hi> ſo it agreed to him in reſpect of the <hi>Inferiour</hi> part of the <hi>Will,</hi> and the <hi>ſenſitive Appetite,</hi> which deſired things naturall and neceſſary for it ſelf, but yet onely thoſe things, that were lawfull and fit. And therefore the <hi>Schools,</hi> though they reſolve, that there was not that <hi>hope</hi>

               </p>
               <p>§. 24.

And ſecondly, as <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>fullneſs</hi> of the <hi>habit</hi> of <hi>Divine Grace,</hi> he loved him alwayes as high with this love, as the preſent ſtate was capable of.

                  <hi>fruit</hi> of his love of <hi>concupiſcence,</hi> and becauſe he was ſenſible of Gods bleſſings and favours; but it was the effect of the <hi>Beatificall viſion,</hi> and the fullneſs of divine Grace ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <hi>infuſed</hi> from the firſt moment of his conception, and <hi>de congruo</hi> both flowed from the <hi>Hypostaticall union.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 25. But then, as the <hi>Schools</hi> diſtinguiſh of a threefold <hi>knowledge</hi> in Chriſt, the one which they call <hi>beata,</hi> the other <hi>infuſa,</hi> and the third <hi>Experimentalis</hi> and <hi>Acquiſita;</hi> ſo there is alſo obſerved by them, a threefold <hi>love</hi> of <hi>complacency</hi> in Chriſt. The firſt is the <hi>beatifick</hi> Love, proper to him as <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſor,</hi> the ſecond the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>infuſed habit</hi> of divine Love; And the third, a Love of <hi>Complacency,</hi> flowing from the frequent <hi>experiences</hi> of Gods goodneſs to him in the dayes of his fleſh. For he alſo did <hi>taſte and ſee how good and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> to him <hi>the Lord was</hi> in that ſtate, when he was truly that <hi>man of ſorrows.</hi> This was <hi>Acquiſite</hi> and <hi>experimentall;</hi> and this we may without any diſhonour to Chriſt, or the leaſt diſparagement to divine truth, ſay, was the iſſue of that other Love, a Love of God for his bleſſings, and gratious aſſiſtance. This was a raviſhing contentment ariſing in the Inferiour part of his ſoul; a ſweet delight and <hi>complacency</hi> in God from the <hi>experience</hi> of his goodneſs, anſwering and ſatisfying thoſe <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires</hi> in theſe <hi>faculties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 26. Now theſe two Loves of God, proper to Chriſt as <hi>viator,</hi> the <hi>naturall</hi> love of God for the bleſſings, we <hi>hope,</hi> and <hi>receive</hi> from him (this love of <hi>deſire,</hi> and that <hi>experimentall, acquiſite</hi> love of <hi>Complacency,</hi> ariſing in the Inferiour faculties of Chriſts ſoul, from the <hi>experiment</hi> of Gods gracious good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) may without any derogation to the <hi>height</hi> and <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of his <hi>ſupernaturall</hi> Love, be ſaid to be capable of <hi>increaſe</hi> and <hi>augmentation.</hi> And of theſe the Doctor muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to ſpeak, §. 39. when he ſayes, that in the time of our Saviours <hi>Agony, there was more occaſion for the heightening of his Love of God and Truſt, then there was at other times.</hi> He never before now had ſuch <hi>occaſion</hi> to Love God, and earneſtly
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:119243:290"/> long for his aſſiſtance, as in his bloody Agony, when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable beams and influence of the Godhead, were now mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly, and by ſpeciall providence <hi>pro tempore</hi> withheld. This made him to cry out upon the Croſs with a <hi>loud voyce, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> this made him to call up all the faculties of his ſoul, and to heighten his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and zeal and fervour in <hi>Prayer,</hi> proportionable to the height of his Agony. As he never was in ſuch a <hi>Paſſion</hi> till now, as he never ſweat <hi>drops</hi> of <hi>blood</hi> before <hi>down to the ground;</hi> ſo he never had ſuch <hi>occaſion</hi> to heighten his <hi>Ardency,</hi> and that his <hi>Love of deſire</hi> towards God and his goodneſs, in reſpect of his preſent aid and ſupport, ſhould be more advanced. The more we are in want and diſtreſs, the more <hi>nature</hi> inſtructs us to love thoſe that help us; and the heightning this love, and our hope, and expectation of aid and aſſiſtance advances and quickens our <hi>Ardency</hi> and fervour in <hi>Prayer;</hi> and the more we <hi>want,</hi> we <hi>love,</hi> we <hi>hope,</hi> we <hi>deſire,</hi> the higher will our <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>devotion</hi> in <hi>Prayer</hi> be inflamed; and this Saint <hi>Luke</hi> meant, when he tells us, that our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>being in an agony,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>he prayed the more earneſtly.</hi> And now ſince <hi>in the dayes of his fleſh he offered up Prayers and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, with ſtrong crying and tears, &amp;c. and was heard in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>that he feared;</hi> ſince he had an <hi>Angell</hi> ſent to <hi>comfort</hi> him; from this <hi>experience</hi> of Gods goodneſs, the <hi>Inferiour faculties</hi> are ſo raviſhed, and ſatisfied, that now his <hi>love</hi> becomes <hi>bold</hi> as a <hi>lyon,</hi> and we hear no more now of theſe <hi>naturall</hi> deſires, prompting him to <hi>pray</hi> for a <hi>removall</hi> of that <hi>bitter cup.</hi> Now boldly as the <hi>Lyon</hi> of the <hi>tribe of Judah,</hi> he ſayes to thoſe that came to apprehend him, <hi>I am he;</hi> and again, <hi>I have told you that I am he. If therefore yee ſeek me, let theſe go their way,</hi> Joh. 18. 5, 6, 7, 8. Now he willingly meets death, and gives thoſe that came to apprehend him leave to take him. Now was this <hi>experimentall</hi> Love of God in the <hi>Inferiour faculties</hi> advanced to the utmoſt height. And now his <hi>Love</hi> was as <hi>ſtrong as death</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p>§. 27. But then though this be abundantly ſufficient to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:119243:290"/> all pretences in this, or any part of our <hi>Refuters</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: yet I muſt remind the Reader, that there is a great deal of difference between the heightning <hi>Chriſts Ardency</hi> in <hi>Prayer</hi> (of which the Doctor ſpeaks) and that advancement of <hi>Chriſts actuall love</hi> as <hi>Comprehenſor,</hi> immediately termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated on God himſelf, of which our <hi>Refuter</hi> ſpeaks in this diſcourſe, and never the Doctor, either in his <hi>Ecteneſteron,</hi> or his Treatiſe of <hi>Will-worſhip,</hi> or the <hi>defence</hi> of it againſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Cawdrey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 28.

                           <p>As for the firſt ſentence, a time of affliction was a ſeaſon for Chriſts ardency to receive ſome growth, if by Ardency, you underſtand the ardency of his Love of God, I deny that it did receive any growth: for to aſcribe growth unto it is to charge it with imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Charitas quamdiu &amp;c.</hi>

               <p> §. 8. I wonder, Sir, that after ſo long a diſpute with the Doctor, you ſhould yet be to ſeek of his meaning. <hi>Review</hi> the whole ſection, and tell me, whether the Doctor has not fully cleared his intention. The <hi>Ardency</hi> he ſpeaks of, is the <hi>Ardency</hi> and <hi>fervour of Prayer,</hi> which he ſayes in this ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſeaſon (as now our Saviours bloody Agony) did receive ſome heightning and growth. And this he affirms from the <hi>Authority</hi> of Saint <hi>Luke.</hi> This is the utmoſt, he ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to demonſtrate, from the firſt to the laſt of this diſcourſe, and his very <hi>title-Page</hi> will make it good. And therefore here Sir, you oppoſe not the Doctors poſition, but another of your own framing. For though <hi>Ardency</hi> in <hi>Prayer</hi> be an <hi>act</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>devotion,</hi> and conſequently of <hi>Charity,</hi> and the <hi>Love</hi> of God, as that is <hi>commonly</hi> taken in ſcripture (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by a <hi>Metonymy,</hi> it is an <hi>effect</hi> and fruit of our Love of God) yet the <hi>Love</hi> of God <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> taken for that <hi>tranſcendent Love,</hi> that is <hi>immediately</hi> fixed on <hi>God,</hi> is <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally</hi> and <hi>really</hi> diſtinct, and clean another thing from <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi> in <hi>Prayer,</hi> as <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> taken. Of the laſt, and ſuch like <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Charity,</hi> as theſe, the Doctor ſpeaks of; of the former onely our <hi>Refuter.</hi> And therefore though it were granted that the <hi>Acts</hi> of this <hi>Love,</hi> as <hi>properly</hi> taken, were not, could not be gradually augmented, yet this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Chriſts <hi>Ardency</hi> in <hi>Prayer</hi> might upon a <hi>juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion</hi> be heightned. The <hi>oppoſition</hi> here, as it is plain, is not <hi>ad idem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 9. But then I deny, that <hi>to aſcribe growth,</hi> or rather graduall heightning and increaſe even to the <hi>Acts</hi> of this <hi>love</hi> in reſpect of his ſtate of <hi>viator</hi> will argue any <hi>imperfection</hi> in this <hi>love,</hi> as reſpecting this <hi>ſtate,</hi> or derogate any thing from the <hi>Perfection</hi> of his <hi>habituall fullneſs</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> as has moſt evidently been already demonſtrated, and I ſhall further inſtantly confirm from our <hi>Refuters</hi> own aſſertions.</p>

               <p>§. 12. But then I muſt withall acknowledge a miſtake of the learned Doctors. For the place is not in <hi>Jeromes</hi> Epiſtle to S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> as he ſuppoſes, and ſayes all along.</p>
               <p>§. 13. For firſt this appears, by the <hi>Inſcription</hi> of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <note place="margin">Hieron. <hi>Tom.</hi> 9. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 44. <hi>p.</hi> 157. <hi>edit. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi>
                  </note> as it lyes in the ninth Tome among S. <hi>Jeromes</hi> works. For it is, <hi>Auguſtinus Hieronymo de eo quod ſcriptum eſt, Qui totam legem obſervaverit.</hi> And the inſcription of <hi>Augustinus Hieronymo</hi> is to be found in the top of every leaf all along that Epiſtle in that very edition.</p>
               <pb n="548" facs="tcp:119243:295"/>
               <p> Secondly, it appears from the very <hi>beginning</hi> of that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>quod ad te ſcripſi, honorande mihi in Chriſto frater Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronyme, quaerens de Animá humanâ, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is evident from the <hi>body</hi> of the Epiſtle. For the Author twice quotes S. <hi>Jeromes</hi> treatiſes againſt <hi>Jovinian,</hi>

Ieromes</hi> Epiſtles, as M. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> had cited it, but in the ninth Tome of <hi>Ieromes</hi> works, he minded not theſe minute circumſtances, but addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf to the buſineſs of the Epiſtle, and finding it not to ſatisfie the pretence of his adverſary, but aiming at another thing, he took out what was fit for his turn, and writing in haſte, and having much buſineſs before him, and the ninth Tome of <hi>S Ieromes</hi> works now in his eye, he might eaſily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the inſcription of the Epiſtle, and put down <hi>S. Ierome</hi> for <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> among whoſe works he now found it. Or elſe, which I rather believe, the Doctor having formerly read this Paſſage in this volume of <hi>Ierome,</hi> and conſidered the full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of it, he might extract, and put down in his <hi>Adverſaria,</hi> that part in ſhort which might ſerve as a <hi>Clavis</hi> to unlock the meaning of the whole, and for brevity ſake (as the cuſtome is) ſet down the place thus, <hi>Hieren. tom.</hi> 9. <hi>p.</hi> 159. which Paſſage he reviewing in his <hi>Adverſaria,</hi> upon this occaſion, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it quoted thus from <hi>S. Ierome,</hi> and M. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> agreeing alſo with him, without further conſideration, and a new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the place, he might take it for the writing of Saint <hi>Ierome.</hi>
               </p>

                  </gap>, either a lapſe of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or haſt and <hi>inadvertencie.</hi> For plain it is from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors anſwer to M. <hi>Cawdrey,</hi> that he had <hi>read</hi> the Epiſtle, and has given the true and genuine ſenſe of the place (except in one particular, wherein I differ from him, and ſhall ſhortly give my reaſons for it) which he could not have done, unleſs he had read it all over, and well conſidered the purport of it. And therefore ſince the Doctor is not deceived in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the place, (except in that particular) the miſtake in the Authours name is not materiall to the preſent buſineſs
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:119243:296"/> and argument he had in hand, and therefore the lapſe is but <hi>veniall, Ipſa enim re</hi> (as <hi>Marianus victorius</hi> in his cenſure of this Tome of S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ſayes very well) <hi>non ſcriptoris nomine veritas aut probatur, aut adulteratur.</hi> And now let our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer</hi> himſelf when the names are changed of <hi>Ierome</hi> into <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> and <hi>Austin</hi> into <hi>Ierome,</hi> ſit in Judgement upon the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors account of that place, and condemn it if he can.</p>
               <p>§. 17. But to come to the place it ſelf, and the uſe our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futer</hi> makes of it. The concluſion and inference he makes from it is this, <hi>To aſcribe growth to the ardency of Chriſts actuall Love, or ſay, that one Act of his Love of God, was gradually heightned and more intenſe than another Act of the ſame Love, is to charge it with imperfection, becauſe Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin ſayes, Charitas quamdiu augeri potest, profecto illud quod minus eſt quam debet, in vitio eſt.</hi> The <hi>words</hi> I acknowledge, but the <hi>Inference</hi> or ſequele I deny; becauſe it ſuppoſes clean an other thing then Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ever meant, which thus I prove.</p>

                  </note> they do ſay, and it concerns them, I am ſure, to make it good) The difference then, as M. <hi>Baxter</hi> thinks, may not be ſo large, as at firſt ſight it ſeems, and in many things, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, it may be more about a contention of words, then any reall difference. And the ſame learned man in his <hi>Aphoriſms</hi> of <hi>Iustification</hi> has <hi>preſumed</hi> to tread out a <hi>Path,</hi> that may help to <hi>reconcile,</hi> not <hi>widen,</hi> not onely theſe differences, but alſo thoſe others of <hi>Antinomianiſme</hi> and <hi>Perfection,</hi> ſo riſe among us at this time.

               </p>
               <p>§. 31. We have ſeen the place as it lyes at large in S. <hi>Austin,</hi> and beheld his ſcope and deſign in that Epiſtle: It remains now we ſhew, how our <hi>Refuter</hi> miſtakes it.</p>
               <p>§. 32. The concluſion he ſhould prove is, that <hi>to aſcribe growth to the Ardency of any Act of Christs love, is to charge it</hi> (that is, the <hi>habit</hi> of divine Grace in him) <hi>with imperfection,</hi> becauſe <hi>Austin</hi> ſayes, <hi>Charitas quamdiu augeri potest, profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto illud quod minus est quam debet, ex vitio eſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 33. And now, not to trouble the Reader with our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futers</hi> Lurking, and hideing himſelf under the Covert of the <hi>Ambiguity</hi> of this Phraſe, <hi>The Love of God,</hi> Plain it is that the place in Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> is wholly miſtaken by him, and
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:119243:299"/> will never ſerve his intereſt, nor prove his concluſion.</p>
               <p>§. 34. For firſt the <hi>Charity S. Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of, is a <hi>habit;</hi> now our <hi>Refuter</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>Acts</hi> of Charity, which differ at leaſt <hi>ſpecie,</hi> but he himſelf (maintains though falſly) do dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>toto genere,</hi> and ſo the attributes of the one, unleſs they be genericall, cannot agree with the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Charity <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of, is not a ſingle Grace, but an univerſall Virtue, ſuch as the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> univerſall <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid: Ariſtot: Eth. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 1. §. 9, 10.</note> Juſtice, that contains all virtues and graces in it, as appears from his own definition.</p>
               <p>But this of our <hi>Refuter</hi> is a ſingle <hi>Act</hi> of divine Love, a ſingle <hi>Act</hi> of one branch or <hi>habit</hi> of this univerſall Charity, or virtue. And this makes the difference greater then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Charity, which <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> ſayes, cannot be increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is <hi>Perfectiſſima, quae quamdiu homo hic vivit eſt in nemine,</hi> That abſolute ſinleſs perfection of Innocence, and compleat obedience to all Gods Commandments. Of this the Doctor declares himſelf expreſly not to ſpeak, but onely of the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this or that virtue or grace in this or that performance. And it is of the graduall difference of the earneſtneſs in Chriſts <hi>prayer</hi> in his Agony, beyond what it was at other times, that our <hi>Refuter</hi> here diſputes againſt by this Authority of <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin.</hi> How fitly now let any man Judge.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Augmentation of that more imperfect <hi>habit</hi> of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of which <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks is <hi>extenſive</hi> to the acquiſition of more graces, as of Piety, Patience, Chaſtity, and the like, as well as <hi>intenſive:</hi> a growth in all Grace, as much as we can, towards a ſinleſs perfection, and exact conformity to all Gods Commandments. But then the Doctor has declared that he ſpeaks of another thing, and onely of the graduall advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Acts</hi> of thoſe Graces above the <hi>Particular</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which a man in ſome caſes, and at ſome times may fullfill, though he have not the <hi>habit</hi> of <hi>ſinleſs Perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 35. And therefore though none in this life may be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely free from ſin, as the good Father conſtantly maintains
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:119243:300"/> againſt the <hi>Pelagian,</hi> and though that righteouſneſs which is ſtill in the growth, falls ſhort of ſuch Perfection, yet thence it will not follow, that a man can do no one <hi>Act</hi> in it ſelf agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Gods Law, or that he may not in ſome <hi>particular Act</hi> do ſomething more, in reſpect of graduall intention and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, then what any particular Law, at all times and in all Caſes, and from all perſons requires. And as this was all the Doctor undertook in that place to make good, ſo it will never be convinced by this ſaying of <hi>S. Austins.</hi> For we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready moſt clearly demonſtrated, that Gods Law requires a greater fervour and height of Ardency in ſome <hi>Acts,</hi> and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſome <hi>Objects,</hi> then in others; and alſo at ſome <hi>Times;</hi> (as to inſtance in our <hi>Acts</hi> of zeal and devotion in a <hi>time</hi> of more then <hi>ordinary trouble</hi> or Calamity. Then not onely <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> has his Pſalm de <hi>Profundis,</hi> but every Chriſtian muſt elſe. This is a ſeaſon when ſignally God calls for it, and we ſin, if we do not now in obedience to his <hi>thundring voyce,</hi> as well lift up our <hi>Hearts,</hi> as our <hi>cryes</hi> and <hi>tongues</hi> to him.) And this is ſo far from being contradicted by S. <hi>Auſtins Charitas perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſſima,</hi> as that it ſuppoſes and requires it, as the ſame <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Et haec eſt perfecta Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia quâ potius potiora, &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus minora di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligimus.</hi> Aug. <hi>de verâ Relig. c.</hi> 49. <hi>vide eund. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Chriſtiana Doct. c.</hi> 27.</note> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther determines, becauſe unleſs the <hi>Acts</hi> were now intended, our Charity would fall ſhort of what Gods Law requires.</p>
               <p>§. 36. Fiftly, whereas M. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> underſtands this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, <hi>Profecto illud quod minus eſt quam debet, ex vitio eſt,</hi> thus; That Charity, whether in the <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Habit,</hi> that comes not up to the higheſt degree or point of graduall intenſion, is imperfect, and faulty; and ſo thence concludes that there be ſet degrees to the Perfection of the <hi>Habit</hi> and the <hi>Act,</hi> and our <hi>Refuter</hi> upon the ſame ſcore, that there are <hi>eight</hi> degrees of graduall intenſion for the <hi>Acts,</hi> and that the Perfection and ſinleſsneſs of every ſingle <hi>Act</hi> of divine Charity conſiſts in this higheſt degree; this is moſt erroneous in it ſelf (as we have already demonſtrated) and clear beſides the meaning of <hi>S.

               <p> §. 37. For here the phraſe <hi>ex vitio est,</hi> is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in a <hi>formall</hi> ſenſe, as if the Father meant, that the <hi>grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Charity</hi> were it ſelf a <hi>ſin</hi> or <hi>faulty</hi> (for then it ſhould be <hi>in vitio eſt,)</hi> but in a <hi>Cauſall</hi> ſenſe, Thus: That moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute righteouſneſs and Legall ſinleſs perfection, beyond which in that Fathers ſenſe, a man cannot go (for let him do all that is required, he can be but innocent and keep Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) is not in any man in this life, but as long as we are <hi>growing</hi> on to it, the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> why by the <hi>Evangelicall diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> we attain it not, ariſes onely from our <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Corruption,</hi> or inbred <hi>Concupiſcence</hi> and proneſs to evill, the <hi>Law in our Members,</hi> which though, for the <hi>Reatus,</hi> it be done away in <hi>Baptiſme;</hi> yet not to the <hi>Fomes</hi> of it, as here immediately, and elſewhere <note n="†" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>§. 38. That this and this onely is his meaning of <hi>Ex vitio eſt,</hi> will appear from two other places even in the very ſame Epiſtle, where he Paraphraſes the word <hi>Vitium,</hi> as we have done. The one preceeds our <hi>Refuters</hi> quotation, thus, <hi>Quis autem ſine aliquo peccato?

               </p>
               <p>§. 39. That this and no other is the meaning of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> will further appear from ſeverall other paſſages of his writings, where treating of the ſame argument, eſpecially againſt the <hi>Pelagians</hi> (whom moſt induſtriouſly and zealouſly he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) he conſtantly reſolves it for <hi>Catholick</hi> doctrine, that though the <hi>Law</hi> requires exact unſinning obedience, and the abſolute Perfection of righteouſneſs (which <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>§. 45. The caſe I think is beyond all poſſibility of excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on plain. The whole is an anſwer to an Objection of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians,</hi> that urged that the full Perfection of righteouſneſs muſt be granted to be attainable in this life, that had actually been attained by holy men, particularly by <hi>Abel,</hi> for of him the Scripture teſtifies that he was righteous, but no where ſpeaks of his ſin, which ſure it would have done, as well as that of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> if he had been any way guilty.</p>
               <p>§. 46. To this S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> anſwers firſt; That there were many things done that are not recorded; and ſo <hi>Abel</hi> might ſin though the Scripture mentions it not, and therefore there is no arguing from Scripture <hi>negatively.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 47. But becauſe he foreſaw this would not ſatisfie the <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> that urged by way of reply, that though this may be poſſible in reſpect of other men, when the world was grown populous, yet it was not probable it ſhould be ſo in the ſtory of onely <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid. de Nat. &amp; Grat. c.</hi> 37.</note> four perſons, eſpecially ſince the Scripture takes notice of <hi>Abels</hi> righteouſneſs, but not of his ſin; of <hi>Adams</hi> and <hi>Eves</hi> and <hi>Cains</hi> ſin, but not of their righteouſneſs. And therefore as the holy Spirit of God bears witneſs expreſly to <hi>Abels</hi> righteouſneſs, ſo there is no ground but empty conjecture, or more improbable and vain Traditions (if any) for his ſin; which may with equall reaſon be denyed as it is urged. <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus igitur,</hi> as the <hi>Pelagian</hi> concludes, <hi>quod legimus, &amp; quod non legimus, nefas credamus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 48. To this in the ſecond place he anſwers, That though
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:119243:303"/> there is no Record extant in Scripture of <hi>Abels actuall</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, yet many there be (particularly that of Rom. 6. 12. <hi>Let not ſin reign in your mortall bodies, that ye ſhould obey it in the lusts thereof</hi>

But leſt this might be too ſhort, in the following chapter he adds, <hi>O utinam non dico aliud quam in illis literis legit, verum contra id quod legit, nihil vellet aſtruere, fideliter &amp; obedienter audiret, quod ſcriptum est. Per unum hominem peccatum intravit in mundum, &amp; per peccatum mors, &amp; ita in omnes homines pertranſiit in quo omnes peccaverunt: &amp; non infirmaret tanti medici gratiam, dum fateri non vult na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam humanam eſſe</hi> vitiatam. <hi>O utinam ſicut Christianus le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geret, praeter Jeſum Chriſtum, nullum eſſe nomen ſub coelo in quo oporteat ſalvos fieri nos, &amp; non poſſibilitatem naturae humanae ita defenderet, ut homo per liberum arbitrium, etiam ſine iſto nomine ſalvus eſſe poſſe credatur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 49. Secondly he anſwers, that we read, it is the duty of every one of the houſhold of faith (of which number the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture records <hi>Abel</hi> to be) to labour <hi>to grow in Grace,</hi> which growth implyes want and imperfection, that ſprings from our <hi>Originall corruption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 50. For the full acquitting of this ſenſe, beſides the whole ſcope and deſign of <hi>S. Auſtins</hi> anſwer, I ſhall deſire here to add what the ſame Father had before replyed in anſwer to another objection of the <hi>Pelagian. c.</hi> 30. of this book. For whereas it had been urged againſt <hi>Originall ſin,</hi> that, <hi>ſuum non eſt ſi neceſſarium eſt, aut ſi ſuum eſt voluntarium eſt, &amp; ſi voluntarium est, vitari poteſt;</hi> He thus replyes, <hi>Non reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus ſuum eſt omnino, ſed</hi> vitium, <hi>quo committitur, nondum omni ex parte ſanatum eſt: quod quidem ut inoleſceret, de non recte uſâ ſanitate deſcendit.</hi> Ex quo vitio <hi>jam male valens. vel infirmitate, vel caecitate plura committ it. Pro quo ſupplican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum eſt, ut ſanetur, &amp; deinceps in perpetuâ ſanitate vivatur, non ſuperbiendum, quaſi homo eadem poteſtate ſanetur, qua po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtate</hi>
                  <pb n="566" facs="tcp:119243:304"/> vitiatus <hi>eſt.</hi> And this I ſuppoſe, will fully clear the true ſenſe and import of the Phraſe, <hi>Ex vitio eſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To return.</p>
               <p>§. 51. <hi>Charitas perfectiſſima</hi> then in <hi>S. Austin</hi> here, and <hi>Charitas quae non poteſt augeri,</hi> is no other but the univerſall habit of all virtues whatſoever, an abſolute Legal Perfection, and that all perfect Charity which falls ſhort of that is not in <hi>S. Auſtins</hi> ſenſe a <hi>ſin</hi> (for that were the direct Opinion of the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> and <hi>Stoicks</hi> which had but now been refuted by him) but is kept in this <hi>imperfect,</hi> and yet <hi>growing</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by reaſon of our <hi>Originall Corruption,</hi> our naturall and ſinfull infirmity, the <hi>fome,</hi> the root of ſin, the luſt in our members, which will be in our natures, and our fleſhly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſo long as we live, and the more we ſin, and ſuffer this corruption to reign, the more we ſhall fall ſhort of this <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 52. And as this is the true and full meaning of <hi>S. Auſtin,</hi> ſo it very well accords with the Doctors aſſertion, but no way ſerves to the intereſt of M. <hi>Cawdrey,</hi> much leſs to this more abſurd poſition of our <hi>Refuter.</hi>

But before I quite leave this place, I muſt crave leave of the Readers patience to acquaint him either with the very great ignorance, or careleſsneſs, or uningenuous dealing of our <hi>Refuter.</hi> For this very place of <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p>§. 63. The onely doubt that can be raiſed of the ſenſe of the Cardinall muſt ariſe from the words, <hi>Externa opera ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientiae &amp; gratiae.</hi> The outward works of wiſdome and Grace wherein he ſayes Chriſt onely encreaſed.</p>
               <p>§. 64. But for the clearing of this, Obſerve we muſt, that here all along <hi>Tolet</hi> does carefully diſtinguiſh theſe three. Firſt <hi>habitum ſapientiae &amp; gratiae,</hi> wherein he allows no increaſe. Secondly, <hi>opera Sapientiae &amp; gratiae,</hi> wherein he allows a true increaſe, and Thirdly, <hi>ostenſionem ſapientiae &amp; gratiae,</hi> the outward ſenſible demonſtration, which he allows to be but an improper increaſe, and no whit agreeable to the words of the Evangeliſt, who ſpeaks of a true and reall increaſe aſwell in wiſdome and Grace, as in Stature, and that in reſpect of God aſwell as Man. And conſequently by the works of Wiſdome
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:119243:309"/> and Grace he muſt of neceſſity mean, the inward and the outward <hi>Acts,</hi> both which the one, as the <hi>Form,</hi> and the other as the <hi>matter</hi> do concur (as the <hi>Moraliſts</hi> and <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> grant and acknowledge, as we have formerly noted) to the compleating of the <hi>morall Acts</hi> of wiſdome and Grace as conſidered in <hi>genere moris.</hi> And theſe he calls <hi>opera externa ſapientiae &amp; gratiae</hi> in a double reſpect. Firſt becauſe the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Acts</hi> themſelves that make up the <hi>Formall</hi> part of the <hi>Action,</hi> or work in a <hi>morall</hi> ſenſe are though <hi>immanent</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>will,</hi> yet <hi>Extrinſecall</hi> to the <hi>Habit</hi> from whence they flow, becauſe the <hi>Habit</hi> is the <hi>cauſe,</hi> and theſe the <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;</hi> and ſecondly, becauſe the outward <hi>Acts</hi> and ſenſible demonſtrations, that are the <hi>Materiall</hi> part of the <hi>Morall work,</hi> are truely extrinſecall and expoſed to the view and apprehenſion and cognizance of the <hi>Exteriour</hi> ſenſes. And thus alſo the learned and very accurate <hi>Suarez</hi> underſtands his maſter <hi>Thomas,</hi> who as <hi>Tolet</hi> here, acknowledges though Chriſt increaſed not according to the <hi>Habit</hi> of wiſdome and Grace, yet <hi>ſecundum opera ſapientiae &amp; gratiae,</hi> according to the <hi>Morall Acts</hi> and works of wiſdome and grace he did truly increaſe, and not onely in <hi>ſhew</hi> and outward <hi>demonſtration.</hi> That the <hi>outward ſenſible expreſſions</hi> onely and with excluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>inward Acts</hi> themſelves cannot here be underſtood is plain from the Authors own words, and we need not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſiſt upon it.

                  <hi>it, Grow in Grace. Let theſe things be in you and abound, as it is ſaid of Chriſt that he encreaſed in wiſdome and favour with God and men, and that he learned obedience by the things that he ſuffered. If it be here objected, that Chriſt was ever full, and had the ſpirit without meaſure, even from the womb; for in as much as his divine nature was in his infancy as fully united to his humane as ever after, therefore the fullneſs of grace which was a conſequence thereupon was as much as ever after. To this I anſwer, that certain it is, that Chriſt was ever full of Grace and Spirit, but that excludes not his growth in them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to the ripeneſs, and by conſequence capacity of his humane nature. Suppoſe we the Sun were vegetable and a ſubject of augmentation, though it could be never true to ſay that it is fuller of light then it was, yet it would be true to ſay that it hath more light now then it had when it was of a leſſer capacity: Even ſo Christ being in all things ſave ſin, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and therefore like us in the</hi> degrees <hi>and</hi> progreſſes <hi>of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall maturity, though he were ever full of Grace, may yet be ſaid to grow in it, and to learn, becauſe as the capacity of his nature was enlarged, the ſpring of Grace within him did riſe up and proportionably fill it.</hi> Thus far D. <hi>Reynolds.</hi>

And yet Reaſon and the Eye tells us, that there is a greater and more perfect diſtance of the <hi>Rayes</hi> in B. then there is in any of the intermediate circles, and none at all in the centre A. and yet for all that there are, nor indeed can, no more <hi>Diameters</hi> paſs through B. then through A. nor can any <hi>Ray</hi> paſs from B, but it muſt alſo come from A: So is it in reſpect of the <hi>Habituall</hi> perfection of Chriſts wiſdome and Grace.

But our comfort is, that we neither ſtand nor fall by the harſh cenſures of ſuch Maſters, and it will appear, at leaſt at the laſt day, who have moſt conſulted the true honour of Chriſt and the Saints, they or we.

               <p>§. 88. Though this calumnie has in part been anſwered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, yet I have ſomethings to add. And firſt, it were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianly to be wiſhed that Paſſion and virulence did not rage ſo much on both ſides, that holy Truth might appear unmask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and free from thoſe clouds that anger and carnall zeal, and worldly Intereſt have thrown about it, and that himſelf and many of his party had not made it their buſineſs to rail at <hi>Calvin</hi> without cauſe, and, as I fear, oftentimes even againſt their own light and conſcience. Secondly, notwithſtanding this courſe language, I muſt ſay that if the opinion were <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin's,</hi> as it is moſt certainly the great <hi>Eraſmus's,</hi> yet it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves not the harſh cenſure of <hi>temerarious</hi> and <hi>abſurd,</hi> that by his own brother <hi>Maldonates</hi> confeſſion has its Originall and Authority from ſo many learned Fathers, and in their diſputes with the <hi>Arrians.</hi> Thirdly, though <hi>Calvin</hi> makes Chriſt to be truly ignorant of ſome things, in particular of the day of Judgement, yet he has the Letter of the Scripture for it; and many of the antient Fathers (as is acknowledged alſo by ſome of their own ſide) interpret that text as <hi>Calvin</hi> does. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſince it appears to all the world, that <hi>Calvin</hi> was a perſon ſo acute and Judicious, notwithſtanding <hi>Stapletons</hi> unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Cenſure, I cannot be perſwaded that he ſhould ground his Aſſertion or confirm it, by ſo weak and ſhallow a proof. And therefore I ſhall ſuſpend my Judgement till the place in <hi>Calvin</hi> be produced, which I believe never will. Fifthly,
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:119243:316"/> that if <hi>Stapleton</hi> himſelf mean the ſame with <hi>Aquinas,</hi> as he ſayes he does, we have already demonſtrated, that the <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> means by the <hi>works of wiſdome and Grace,</hi> the whole <hi>morall Act</hi> that conſiſts of the inward <hi>elicite Acts</hi> of the <hi>will</hi> as the <hi>Form,</hi> and the outward <hi>Imperate</hi> ſenſible works, as the Matter of it, as is acknowledged by his brother <hi>Suarez</hi> in his Commentary on that place, and by <hi>Lucas Brugenſis</hi> in his Commentary on S. <hi>Luke</hi> formerly cited. And this is more then an increaſe in regard of <hi>Oſtenſion</hi> and the <hi>opinion</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> a reall increaſe in the <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>Elicite Acts</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as is acknowledged expreſly by many learned men of their own already quoted. And if he and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpeak ſenſe, and Chriſt did grow in favour with God and man, as he expreſly (and <note n="†" place="margin">

               <p>§. 89. For it is a generally received truth amongſt the <hi>Moralists</hi> and <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> that as the <hi>inward</hi> and the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Act</hi> do both concurr to make up and compleat a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall work</hi> or <hi>Act,</hi> ſo all the <hi>goodneſs</hi> and <hi>dignity</hi> and <hi>merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> acceptableneſs of it ariſes onely from the interiour and <hi>Elicit Act,</hi> and not at all from the <hi>Imperate</hi> and exterior. For as in <hi>Naturalls</hi> ſo in <hi>Moralls,</hi> it is the <hi>Form</hi> that gives being and worth to the thing <hi>Formed.</hi> And for this we have already quoted <hi>Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Durand</hi> and <hi>Suarez</hi> and others, and I think no rationall man doubts it.</p>
               <p>§. 90. And therefore, if as <hi>Stapleton</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> both grant, that <hi>Chriſt did daily more and more gratious works in the ſight and Judgement of God and man,</hi> and if it be true, (as <hi>Tolet</hi> and <hi>Lucas Brugenſis</hi> poſitively ſay) that Chriſts
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:119243:317"/> 
                  <hi>Faſt</hi> of <hi>forty</hi> dayes was more <hi>meritorious</hi> and <hi>acceptable</hi> to God, then one of <hi>three</hi> would have been; and the blood ſhed at his <hi>Paſſion</hi> was in the reall <hi>Phyſicall</hi> value more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and meritorious, then that ſhed at his <hi>circumciſion,</hi> as the ſame <hi>Brugenſis</hi> (which neither <hi>Bellarmine</hi> nor <hi>Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> I ſuppoſe will deny) and <hi>Suarez</hi> has largely demonſtrated; then it evidently follows, that there was (and by themſelves, if they will ſpeak conſequently, it muſt be granted) a true and <hi>reall</hi> increaſe in the <hi>inward Acts</hi> themſelves, and where the whole <hi>morall work</hi> is more <hi>phyſically</hi> valuable and <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious</hi> and acceptable in the ſight of God and Man, there the inward and <hi>elicite Act</hi> proceeding from the <hi>habit</hi> muſt alſo be more noble. And then if this be their meaning, they had little reaſon to quarrell with <hi>Calvin,</hi> that in the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our <hi>Field,</hi> means the ſame, and ſo in this they may be friends, at leaſt with the greateſt part of <hi>Calvin's</hi> followers, who declare this to be their meaning.</p>
               <p>§. 91. But if they underſtand no other proficiency and increaſe, then onely in regard of Outward ſeeming appearance and manifeſtation, as yet I know of no Proteſtant of their Judgement, but our <hi>Refuter,</hi> and uncertain I am, whether (unleſs he will abſolutely run from himſelf in his <hi>Mixture,</hi> where he quarrels at <hi>Bellarmine</hi> for this doctrine) he will long continue their Proſelyte.</p>
               <p>§. 92. And now being come to the Foot of our Account, it is fit we caſt up our ſumme total; that we may truly bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance and ſtate the difference between the <hi>Refuter</hi> and the Doctor.</p>
               <p>§. 93. Firſt then the <hi>Refuter</hi> ſayes, he is <hi>confident that no learned man, either Proteſtant or Papist, beſides this Replyer, hath aſſerted any ſuch growth unto the Ardency of Chriſts A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall Love of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now upon the Account we have found, that this is the <hi>Generall Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Reformed Divines</hi> and many learned
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:119243:317"/> 
                  <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and oppoſed by none, but ſuch as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Stapleton</hi> and <hi>Maldonate,</hi> that vent any thing in their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger againſt thoſe they call hereticks, and by theſe not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but onely <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> and in ſhew, if they will ſpeak conſequently to themſelves, and the received Maximes of their own Schools.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we have found that <hi>Eraſmus</hi> clearly and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and D. <hi>Eckardus,</hi> and upon the matter <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Piſcator</hi> and others do expound S. <hi>Luke</hi> of a reall increaſe of the very <hi>habits</hi> of wiſdome and Grace in the humane nature of our Saviour, and that the ſame Doctrine is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Stapleton</hi> and <hi>Maldonate,</hi> upon <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Calvin, Zuinglius, Bucer, Beza,</hi> and generally on the the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> and <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and that M. <hi>Calvin</hi> in his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions</hi> does ſeem to ſay as much.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we have found that the learned Cardinall <hi>Tolet,</hi> though he does not approve, yet he does not condemn that expoſition, and <hi>Janſenius</hi> allows it as <hi>Catholick,</hi> and leaves <note place="margin">Janſen. ſupra citat.</note> it as indifferent to his Reader, whether he follow this or the other.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is acknowledged by <hi>Janſenius</hi> that <hi>Ambroſe</hi>

               <p>§. 94. And now let our <hi>Refuter</hi> himſelf and the whole world Judge, does he not appear moſt unfortunate in his <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence?</hi> And has not his Ambition to be read and accounted a Confuter of D. <hi>Hammond</hi> betrayed him to the ruine of his
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:119243:318"/> Credit? And has not his <hi>uſe of Confutation,</hi> and the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> of that <hi>uſe</hi> brought an umbrage and a Cloud on his whole <hi>Mixture,</hi> howſoever otherwiſe learned? and the <hi>Practicall</hi> Divinity confuted the <hi>Scholaſticall?</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt tell him, that I truly Pity his misfortune, that has as much ſullyed his Fame and learning, by his <hi>confidence</hi> as <hi>wavering,</hi> and that, <hi>Heroſtratus</hi> like, he ſhould ſet fire to Doctor <hi>Hammond's</hi> glorious ſtructure to gain himſelf an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious name.</p>
               <p>§. 95. But then withall I muſt add, that if he had not been miſtaken in his <hi>Confidence,</hi> yet he had been very much miſtaken in his <hi>Judgement.</hi> For the Doctor no where aſcribes any ſuch growth, as he here means, to the <hi>Ardency</hi> of Chriſts <hi>Actuall</hi> Love of God. And I publickly challenge him to ſhew it, in the ſenſe that he ſpeaks of. And ſo the Doctor is ſecure and ſtill ſafe, notwithſtanding his <hi>Reaſon,</hi> his <hi>Authority,</hi> and <hi>Confidence.</hi> Go we on then to the next.</p>

               <p>§. 3. To the firſt I could wiſh Sir you had told us the Place; for as yet I know not where to find it. I remember indeed the Doctor aſſerts, and makes good in his Treatiſe of <hi>will-worſhip,</hi> that Chriſts <hi>Ardency</hi> in <hi>Prayer</hi> was heightened in his <hi>Agony,</hi> and M. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> in his <hi>Triplex Diatribe</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges <note place="margin">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> contends for. And will you be ſo cruelly paſſionate, to <hi>wound</hi> a <hi>Friend,</hi> that you may ſtrike him you count an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,</hi> becauſe <hi>he tells you the truth?</hi> If M. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> be Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, then ſurely Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> is unjuſtly oppoſed, and if the Doctors Tenet be erroneous, then M. <hi>Cawdrey</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf muſt fall under that <hi>uſe of Confutation,</hi> that was firſt written in his <hi>Defence.</hi> Either then Sir take in your bloody flagg of defiance that you hang out with ſuch Terrour and Menace in your <hi>Title-Page,</hi> or let the world plainly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand your <hi>new</hi> and exquiſite <hi>Policy</hi> to <hi>confute</hi> by an <hi>Apology,</hi> and though you name onely Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> yet you alſo
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:119243:320"/> mean M. <hi>Cawdrey,</hi> though as the world now goes, you muſt ſeem to abet him. Compare your <hi>Title-Page,</hi> and this very paſſage together, and ſee whether it fits beſt, M. <hi>Cawdrey,</hi> or the Doctor. But, not to intrude upon your ſecret thoughts and deſigns, you plainly here manifeſt to the world, that you have read the Doctors <hi>Account,</hi> and Anſwer to the <hi>Triplex Diatribe.</hi> And therefore I muſt proclaim you inexcuſable, as well for not underſtanding, if not plainly perverting the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors ſenſe, ſo expreſly there declared, as for not taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice at all of the Anſwers he made to many of your Objections, before you undertook to Refute his <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>§. 4. And therefore what you add. <hi>But love is predicated by the outward expreſſions thereof onely analogically,</hi> Analogiâ <hi>attributionis extrinſecae, ſicut ſanitas dicitur de urinâ,</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>§. 5. For the Doctor confounds not the Outward Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with the Inward Acts, but onely <hi>à poſteriori</hi> concludes the heightening of the one, by the multiplying and aggranda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and growth of the other. As then the Philoſopher col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects and demonſtrates the Cauſe by the Effect, as the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner portends the greatneſs of the ſtorm by the leaps and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Porcpiſce, and other ſigns and obſervations, as the Mathematician from the print of <hi>Hercules</hi> foot in the ſand or ſnow did find out the true dimenſions of his Body: ſo S. <hi>Gregory</hi> has told us, that <hi>probatio dilectionis, exhibitio eſt operis,</hi> that <hi>the performance of the outward work, is the true Index and Touchstone and proof of our Love.</hi> And nature it ſelf teaches us, without any other Tutor, to conclude the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Affection to be greateſt, where the Outward Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Love are moſt eminent.</p>
               <p>§. 6. Though then Love as you ſay <hi>is predicated of the Outward Expreſſions thereof onely analogically, analogiâ attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butionis extrinſecae, ſicut ſanitas de urina,</hi> yet ſince the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Expreſſions, if true and genuine, and not hypocriticall
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:119243:320"/> and counterfeit, are the Fruits and ſigns of the Inward Affection, we may then, by the Graduall difference of them, conclude the Riſe or Abatement of that Love, as the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician</hi> judges of the <hi>health</hi> or <hi>ſickneſs</hi> of his <hi>patient,</hi> by his <hi>urine</hi> and other <hi>ſymptomes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 7. And therefore Sir, if you will but grant me (as you do the Doctor) <hi>that a Tempeſtuous time, a Time of Chriſts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, was a ſeaſon for his zeal to pour it ſelf out more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſely, even in</hi> Outward Expreſſions, <hi>then at a calmer ſeaſon,</hi> I ſhall not doubt to conclude that his Inward Devotion was alſo then more enlarged. I never read of any but the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite</hi> and <hi>Crocodile</hi> that have Tears at <hi>command,</hi> and can aſſume a ſad countenance, and at pleaſure <hi>disfigure their faces,</hi> and counterfeit a paſſion. True zeal and devotion knowes no other expreſſions, then what are Naturall and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine. Gods Spirit gives no Rules, no Examples for the heightening of our Outward Devotion onely, nor to make a Trade of lifting up the eye, and ſmiting the breaſt, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Tears full and raiſing of our Cryes and Noiſe. They were the <hi>Phariſees</hi> onely that did teach and practiſe ſuch Arts; and I read of miſcreant <hi>Jews</hi> that were profeſſed <hi>Praeficae,</hi> and hired mourners at funeralls. We need no Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors nor Inſtructors to teach us to expreſs the true paſſions of the heart. They, whether we will or no, uncommanded, unthought of, riſe and fall, as the ſoul it ſelf is affected. Nature teaches us this leſſon, and it is the firſt that we pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. The Child, the more it longs after the Mother or the Nurſe, the more it cryes and ſheds tears; and the further they go from it, the louder ſtill it calls, and the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, more violent are the Shrikes and lamentations. If a man be fallen into a Pit, or have loſt his way among the Woods, the deeper he finds the Pit, and the more remote from any Village, or company, that he conceives himſelf to be, the louder he calls, and the more multiplies his cryes. It is juſt ſo with a truly ſanctified ſoul. The more eager and violent is her Love of God, the more earneſtly it longs and <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 1, and 12.</note>
                  <pb n="600" facs="tcp:119243:321"/> yearns after him, and the comforts of his preſence: and when God withdraws himſelf from it, the further that he ſeems to remove, the deeper ſtill is the ſigh, the more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Proſtration, the more dejected the countenance, and the more earneſt are the Cryes, and more plentifull the Tears, and the more ardent ſtill the Prayers. Our earneſt Longings and <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 42. <hi>per tot.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>pantings</hi> after God and the Joy of his countenance, without any other Monitor and Inſtructor can advance and heighten our devotions. Indeed nothing but Love, and more then ordinary Affection can quicken and raiſe them, as nothing but <hi>Moſes Rod</hi> could make the <hi>Waters</hi> flow, and guſh forth from the <hi>Rock</hi> in the Wilderneſs. Love is often compared to Fire: As then the Fire muſt raiſe the Spirits in the <hi>Alembick</hi> before any water can diſtill, and drop; and as the more Spirits are raiſed by it, the more Water iſſues forth: ſo the Flames of holy Love muſt firſt raiſe the ſpirit of zeal and devotion in us, before it will diſſolve into Tears, and breathe out in Sighs, and as that ſpirit of zeal and true devotion does increaſe, the deeper will be the Groan, the more vehement will be our Prayers. And therefore S. <note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 27. 46. Mar. 15. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> tells us, that our Saviour, when <note n="*" place="margin">

And though you beguile your ſelf and others with the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity of this Term, <hi>the Love of God,</hi> yet the Doctors mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſo plain, that it is impoſſible for any man to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in it, that reſolves not to be willingly miſtaken.</p>
               <p>§. 10. But you are not deluded in your hopes.

               <p>§. 14. To your firſt queſtion I return, that it is readily
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:119243:322"/> granted. For every prudent Father does often deal ſo with the child, he moſt loves; and God himſelf ſometimes in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <hi>hides his face,</hi> and withdraws the light of his countenance from his dear children and ſervants, when yet with <hi>an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Love</hi> he affects, <hi>and with everlasting kindneſs will have</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 31 3. Iſa. 54. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>mercy upon them.</hi> But will you thence conclude againſt the expreſs letter of the Goſpell, that Chriſts earneſtneſs in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was not greater in his Agony, then at other times? Sir, you muſt conſider that you are not now to remonſtrate, what may poſſibly come to paſs, or what in other men, at other times, and in other caſes happens, but what <hi>de facto</hi> then was at the time of our Saviours bloody Agony. And who ſees not, at firſt glance, that your Proofs fall a hundred ſhort of your Concluſion? For we are not now upon the diſquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and enquiry of what was <hi>Phyſicê</hi> and naturally poſſible, but what was <hi>Morally</hi> ſuch, and what <hi>de facto,</hi> according to S. <hi>Lukes</hi> plain Narration, and the ordinary courſe and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of men, did then come to paſs. And therefore ſince the Rule of the Law is, that <hi>illud poſſumus quod Jure poſſumus,</hi> if it has already appeared, and clearly been demonſtrated, that the Chriſtian Grace of <hi>Sincerity</hi> does <hi>ordinarily</hi> and in moſt caſes require it, and <hi>uſually,</hi> where the Charity is true and perfect, and not counterfeit, or innocently concealed for the advantage of the beloved, there is, and ought to be a proportionable correſpondence between the Outward and the Inward Acts of Love, and as the one falls or riſes, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in Proportion do the other, then it will not be enough to inferr (which yet is all you conclude) that <hi>the degrees of the inward Acts of Love may not onely equall, but alſo tranſcend the most ſincere expreſsions,</hi> you muſt prove that they ſtill muſt and ought to do ſo, which I think will be impoſſible. But yet let me tell you, that if you ſhould perform this more then <hi>Herculean</hi> Task, you will ſtill be very far ſhort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding any thing againſt the Doctor. For again I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you, that we are not now ſpeaking of the <hi>Elicite</hi> Acts of the <hi>Formall</hi> virtue of Charity, and the Love of God <hi>properly</hi> taken, but onely of the <hi>Imperate</hi> Acts of that
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:119243:323"/> Charity the Ardency of Prayer, which is onely Tropically ſuch, and this will yet make your task more impoſſible.</p>

               <p> §. 31. In ſhort, though <hi>Man</hi> by the <hi>Legall Covenant</hi> were bound to abſolute ſin-leſs perfection, yet <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 6. 34.</note>

Chriſt as man was alwaies obliged unto the moſt intenſe, ardent and fervent inward Acts of love of God, but he was not alwayes obliged unto the moſt intenſe expreſsions of theſe inward Acts, the reaſon of the difference between his obligation unto the intenſion of the inward Acts of his Love, and his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation unto the intenſion of the outward expreſsions thereof, you may fetch from what is ſaid by <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſecunda ſecundae, q. 27. art. 6. ad tertium. <hi>Nec eſt ſimile de interiori actu Charitatis, &amp; exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioribus actibus.

               <p>§. 36. The Argument ſtands thus; If Chriſt as man were obliged to the moſt intenſe Inward Acts, but not to the moſt intenſe Outward expreſſions, then there may be a graduall

               </p>
               <p>§. 37. The Aſſumption conſiſts of two parts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be anſwered at once.</p>
               <p>§. 38. To the firſt part then I ſay, that this Propoſition, <hi>Chriſt as man was alwayes obliged unto the moſt intenſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Acts of Love of God,</hi> is very ambiguous, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be diſtinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>Firſt then Chriſt as <hi>Man,</hi> may be conſidered according to his twofold ſtate, either of <hi>Comprehenſor</hi> in the ſuperiour part of his ſoul, or as <hi>Viator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly this term, <hi>The love of God,</hi> may be diverſly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. For firſt either it may ſignifie the Love of God <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,</hi> and as taken in a <hi>Formall ſenſe,</hi> for that which the <hi>Schools</hi> call <hi>Dilectio Dei,</hi> and <hi>Aquinas</hi> and the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> call <hi>Charitas ut finis;</hi> or <hi>Metonymically,</hi> and in a <hi>Cauſall</hi> ſenſe for the Love of our Neighbour for Gods ſake, or any other virtue or Grace of the firſt table, ſuppoſe of Religion, and the like, that ſprings from the Love of God, and is in order to him. And this is that which the <hi>Schools</hi> call <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas ut medium</hi> and <hi>Charitas Praecepti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, this phraſe, <hi>the moſt intenſe, ardent and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent inward Acts of love,</hi> may be variouſly taken. For firſt, either they may ſignifie the moſt intenſe <hi>abſolutely</hi> and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that the humane nature of Chriſt, either by the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent power of God can, or elſe <hi>de facto</hi> ſhall ever arrive at. Or ſecondly, <hi>Comparatively;</hi> and that either firſt in reſpect of the Law, or ſecondly, in reſpect of the preſent State, or thirdly, in reſpect of the <hi>grace</hi> or quality <hi>preciſely</hi> and <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractly</hi> conſidered.</p>
               <p>§. 39. Now unleſs theſe be diſtinctly conſidered, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to give a true and ſatisfactory anſwer. And for want of this diſtinct conſideration it is, that our <hi>Refuter</hi> all along is ſo confuſed in his diſcourſe, and expoſed to ſo many errours and miſtakes.</p>
               <pb n="615" facs="tcp:119243:329"/>
               <p> §. 40. Firſt then Chriſt as Man conſidered in the ſtate of <hi>comprehenſor,</hi> and enjoying the <hi>beatificall viſion</hi> in his mind, was not under any <hi>Obligation</hi> to love God, becauſe as the learned <hi>Chamier</hi> well obſerves, Precepts are not given to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, becauſe they <note place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, Chriſt as conſidered in the ſtate of <hi>viator,</hi> was not obliged to the moſt intenſe Act <hi>ſimply</hi> and abſolutely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable, or as enjoyed by him as <hi>Comprehenſor,</hi> for this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes a contradiction <hi>in Adjecto,</hi> that he ſhould be <hi>Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſor</hi> and <hi>viator</hi> in one and the ſame reſpect.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt as <hi>viator,</hi> was obliged to the moſt intenſe love of God <hi>formally</hi> taken, that he in that ſtate could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly arrive at, by the aſſiſtance of grace.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Chriſt as <hi>viator,</hi> was obliged to the moſt intenſe Acts of Charity <hi>Metonymically</hi> taken, that the Law of God ſtill required.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The quality and grace of the love of God, <hi>properly</hi> taken, as <hi>preciſely</hi> and <hi>abſtractly</hi> conſidered, has no ſet limits, and periods, beyond which it cannot be increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, no ſuch <hi>gradus ad octo,</hi> as all other <hi>Naturall Qualities,</hi> capable of <hi>intenſion</hi> and <hi>remiſſion,</hi> have. And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor Chriſt nor any Man elſe, is obliged to any one ſuch higheſt degree.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, the love of God, as <hi>Metonymically</hi> taken, for the love of our Neighbours, has its ſet bounds and limits. For we muſt love them <hi>as our ſelves,</hi> and ſome more, ſome leſs, according to their nearneſs of allyance and kindred, and Countrey, and the grace of God ſhining in them, and the like. And therefore it is reſolved in the <hi>Schools,</hi> that <hi>datur ordo in charitate.</hi> And then for the other virtues and graces, they have all (except the three Theologicall Graces
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:119243:330"/> of Faith, Hope, and Charity, that have an infinite <hi>Object,</hi> God, and therefore can have no limits) their exceſſes, as well as defects, they have their ſet periods and bounds, they conſiſt as <hi>Aquinas</hi> reſolves in a middle point between two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams. But then this middle point alſo is not like the <hi>Ecli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pticke,</hi> but the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> and conſiſts in a Latitude. And therefore</p>
               <p>Seventhly, in theſe laſt the Law requires not at all times the moſt intenſe degree of the Act, but onely ſuch a degree as befits the <hi>Object</hi> at this time, and with relation to all other Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>§. 41. And hence it is that the Doctor ſpeaking onely of ſome of theſe Acts in particular, affirms them to conſiſt in a latitude, and that in reſpect of the <hi>particular</hi> Law obliging <hi>all men</hi> to the performance of them, there may be degrees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that <hi>particular</hi> command, that God leaves to our Liberty <hi>freely</hi> to exerciſe, that ſo we may have ſomething to offer to him <hi>freely,</hi> out of thoſe very graces, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has <hi>freely</hi> beſtowed upon us. And conſequently that Chriſt in the Acts and Exerciſe of theſe, (in particular the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi> of <hi>Prayer)</hi> was not alwayes obliged to one equall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form higheſt degree of intenſneſs. And therefore the firſt part of his <hi>Aſſumption</hi> as confronted to D. <hi>Hammonds</hi> Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is unſound.</p>
               <p>§. 42. All theſe in their ſeverall orders have been largely proſecuted and confirmed, and therefore nothing now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, but that we proceed to the ſecond part or Propoſition contained in the <hi>Aſſumption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 43. And it is this; <hi>But Chriſt was not alwayes obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged unto the moſt intenſe expreſſions of theſe inward Acts of his Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 44. To which I anſwer; that if by the <hi>Expreſſion of theſe inward Acts,</hi> he means the <hi>outward ſenſible expreſſions</hi>
                  <pb n="617" facs="tcp:119243:330"/> of the inward acts, it is thus far granted, that nor Chriſt, nor any man elſe is obliged to any one <hi>particular act</hi> or <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>outward expreſsion,</hi> ſuppoſe in prayer, to uſe any one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular geſture, or language, or form, and the like, but by Gods law is left indifferent to uſe any, that is <hi>quoad ſpecifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem</hi> decent and fitting.</p>
               <p>§. 45. But then I muſt add that <hi>Aquinas</hi> his authority comes not up to this purpoſe, nor am I moved to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for any reaſon, that I, or any man elſe can gather from the paſſage cited to confirm it. For <hi>Aquinas</hi> here means not by the <hi>exteriour acts</hi> of charity the <hi>outward ſenſible expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of it, but onely the performances of thoſe duties and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the firſt and ſecond table, <hi>quae ſunt in ordine ad finem,</hi> which God requires us to perform in order to our laſt end, and happineſs, our eternall <hi>union</hi> and ſight, and love, and enjoyment of God in heaven. The <hi>exteriour acts</hi> of <hi>charity,</hi> he there means, are, I ſay, no other, then the acts and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all virtues and graces whatſoever, as no man, that is any way verſed in that Author, can be ignorant.</p>
               <p>§. 46. But becauſe our <hi>Refuter</hi> is a <hi>Schoolman</hi> and a <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,</hi> and reſolves to <hi>diſpute every inch of ground with us,</hi> I ſhall for a full diſplaying of his Ignorance proceed to make it good.</p>
               <p>§. 47. Thus then I lay down the full ſenſe of the place. By this <hi>interior actus charitatis</hi> the inward act of divine love, the <hi>Schoolman</hi> means the <hi>immanent</hi> and <hi>elicite act</hi> of that love, that is immediately fixed on God, in which love mans laſt happineſs conſiſts. This other where he calls <hi>finis praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pti</hi> from S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy, the end of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment;</hi> becauſe all the commandments onely drive at this, and aim to bring us unto God. And in the place here urged he ſayes, it has <hi>rationem finis,</hi> becauſe mans laſt happineſs conſiſts in this love, and this union of the ſoul with God in heaven. By the <hi>exteriour acts</hi> of charity he means not the
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:119243:331"/> 
                  <hi>materiall ſenſible expreſſions</hi> (as for inſtance, the more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of tears, deeper ſighs, more patheticall phraſes, and forms, and expreſſions, more humble geſtures of the body in prayer; which is all the heightening and advancement our <hi>Refuter</hi> will allow to our Saviours <hi>ardency</hi> in <hi>prayer</hi> in the garden) not the <hi>outward acts,</hi> but <hi>morall duties</hi> and gratious works and performances of any virtue, or grace, that the law of God preſcribes.</p>
               <p>§. 48. The firſt are <hi>elicite acts</hi> of divine love, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>immanent</hi> and <hi>interiour</hi> to it. But theſe latter <hi>morall duties</hi> are <hi>imperate</hi> acts of that love. And therefore though they are or may be <hi>intrinſecall</hi> to the <hi>will,</hi> wherein they are <hi>ſubjected;</hi> yet are they <hi>extrinſecal</hi> to <hi>charity,</hi> belong not to the <hi>formall eſſence</hi> and nature of it, but are <hi>outward fruits,</hi> and effects and ſymptomes of it; becauſe the more the man loves God, the more he will labour to keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the more ſincere and cordiall he is in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of any duty or grace, the more it appears that he truly loves God, that has commanded it. But then though theſe be <hi>exteriour</hi> (becauſe <hi>imperate)</hi> acts of divine love, yet in their <hi>formall</hi> nature and <hi>eſſence,</hi> they are <hi>immanent</hi> acts of the <hi>will,</hi> becauſe they are the <hi>elicite acts</hi> of the virtuous <hi>habits</hi> there ſeated; and conſequently they are not, as our <hi>Refuter</hi> very ignorantly, <hi>outward corporeall ſenſible</hi> tokens and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</hi> For the <hi>exteriour Acts</hi> of <hi>Charity,</hi> he ſpeaks of, he ſayes are <hi>ſiout ad finem,</hi> ſuch which God has commanded us to perform, as the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>means</hi> that we may be perfectly united to him, and ſee and enjoy his goodneſs in the land of the living, and love him eternally, <hi>&amp; ideo ſunt commenſur an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, &amp; ſecundum charitatem &amp; ſecundum rationem,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are to be meaſured and proportioned according to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and reaſon; which words cannot poſſibly have any ſenſe after the meaning of our <hi>Refuter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 49. Now that this and no other is the meaning of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas,</hi> will appear from the very queſtion it ſelf, the anſwer

               <p>§. 61. Plain then it is, Firſt that here he <hi>confounds</hi> the ſtate of Chriſt as <hi>comprehenſor,</hi> with his ſtate of <hi>viator,</hi> Secondly, plain it is, that he confounds the <hi>beatifick</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> acts of Chriſts love of God, agreeing to him as <hi>comprehenſor,</hi> with the <hi>free</hi> and <hi>meritorious</hi> acts of his love agreeing to him as <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator.</hi> And then thirdly, plain it is, that he confounds the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> acts of Chriſts <hi>love</hi> of God, as <hi>properly</hi> taken with the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> acts of other <hi>virtues</hi> and <hi>graces,</hi> ſuppoſe of <hi>religion,</hi> and <hi>ardency</hi> in <hi>prayer,</hi> which becauſe they are the effects and ſigns of that former love of God, are <hi>Metonymically</hi> ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

               <p>§. 62. But then, as if this were not ſufficient, he fifthly further confounds the <hi>outward ſenſible expreſſions</hi> of charity <hi>largely</hi> taken, with the <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>piety,</hi> that, as we have formerly manifeſted, are <hi>extrinſecall</hi> to the love of God <hi>ſtrictly</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> taken, and makes the <hi>inward</hi> acts of <hi>religion</hi> and <hi>devotion,</hi> of <hi>chastity</hi> and <hi>temperance,</hi> of <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>brotherly kindneſs</hi> and the like, to be, upon the matter, all
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:119243:334"/> one with the <hi>outward ſenſible expreſſions</hi> of theſe virtues and graces. And then ſixtly he confounds the <hi>naturall neceſſity</hi> and <hi>freedome</hi> of the <hi>Agent</hi> with the <hi>morall neceſſity</hi> and <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> of the <hi>action.</hi>

               <p>§. 63. For the better opening of which laſt (for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer need not further clearing) know we muſt that the <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> diſtribute <hi>neceſſity</hi> and <hi>freedome</hi> into three kinds. The firſt is that they call <hi>neceſſitas naturae,</hi> and this ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from a <hi>naturall determination</hi> of the form and faculties of the Agent to one uniform kind of working, and is <hi>intrinſecall</hi> to it. To this they oppoſe that <hi>freedome</hi> which they call <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,</hi> which ariſes from an <hi>indetermination</hi> of the <hi>rationall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,</hi> called the <hi>will,</hi> to one uniform kind of <hi>operation,</hi> and ſuppoſes it <hi>naturally</hi> left at liberty either to act or not act, (which they call <hi>libertatem contradictionis</hi> or <hi>Exercitii)</hi> or elſe to do this, or that, which is contrary to it, (which they call <hi>libertatem contrarietatis, ſeu ſpecificationis)</hi> and this at its own <hi>free election</hi> and <hi>choice.</hi> Thus ſtones and vegetables and the like are called <hi>neceſſary agents,</hi> but Men and Angels are called <hi>agentia libera,</hi> free agents: and this freedome is as eſſentiall and naturall to theſe, as the other neceſſity is to the former. The ſecond they call <hi>neceſſitas praecepti,</hi> a neceſſity of duty ariſing from the <hi>morall</hi> obligation in the <hi>action</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it to be performed, or omitted by a <hi>free creature,</hi> that is lord of his own actions. And to this is oppoſed that <hi>morall liberty</hi> and <hi>freedome,</hi> and <hi>indifferency</hi> of the <hi>act,</hi> whereby it comes to paſs, that it may be done, or omitted without ſin, no law here interpoſing, to command or prohibit it. Thus whatſoever the law of God has enjoyned or forbidden, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and whatſoever is not thus forbidden or commanded is of a middle nature, <hi>ſecundum ſpeciem</hi> indifferent and <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally free</hi> to be done, or not done. And this is a liberty <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall</hi> to the <hi>Agent.</hi> The third they call <hi>neceſſitas coactio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> ariſing from outward violence and compulſion. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:119243:335"/> the <hi>will</hi> cannot poſſibly be enforced, it is improperly called neceſſity, and though in reſpect of the outward danger impending the <hi>will</hi> moves againſt its own genuine inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet in the act and exerciſe it <hi>voluntarily</hi> chuſes that, which if the force were not impending, it would not have embraced.

               <p>§. 68. If here he ſhall reply; though this be true in reſpect of all other men, yet the caſe is otherwiſe with Chriſt; <hi>The reaſon here is peculiar unto him above all other men: whileſt</hi>

               <p>§. 69. If he underſtand his aſſertion in the ſecond Notion of liberty, for <hi>a morall indifferency</hi> of the action it ſelf, plain it is, that Chriſt had no more morall freedome and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency to many, if not to moſt of the outward expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then to the inward Acts themſelves. For where the <hi>outward act</hi> and expreſſion does <hi>aeque cadere ſub praecepto</hi> and is aſwell the <hi>object</hi> and matter of <hi>duty</hi> commanded, as the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward act,</hi> there both outward and inward act are equally neceſſary to be bone or omitted. I deſire him to tell me, what greater liberty and indifferency there was to Chriſt in reſpect of the outward acts of all the <hi>negative precepts</hi> of the moral law more then to the inward acts? what liberty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, there was in reſpect of the outward acts of many of the <hi>affirmative precepts</hi> more then to the inward acts? was he not aſwell bound, at leaſt in moſt caſes, to the outward acts of adoration, of honouring Gods name, of reverence to parents and the like, as he was to the inward acts? But then what thinks he of all the <hi>Moſaicall rites</hi> and <hi>ceremoniall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances,</hi> which clearly conſiſted in the exterior Act? As he was born of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and <hi>under the law,</hi> ſo was he not bound upon pain of <hi>exciſion</hi> to be circumciſed the eight day?

If here he ſhall reply that he ſpake not of the outward expreſſions that were matter of duty and under command, but onely of thoſe expreſſions of the inward acts, that were left indifferent, ſuch as are the outward proſtrations and geſtures, the words and other ſigns of the inward arden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in prayer; (though it is evident that his words indefinitely propoſed muſt reach to all the outward acts and expreſſions of the inward acts of divine love, that neceſſarily iſſued from the beatificall viſion, yet) I ſhall for the preſent accept of this anſwer, (though nothing at all to the words and the purpoſe of this his ſecond reaſon, <hi>which</hi> he ſayes <hi>is peculiar to Christ above all other men).</hi> But then withall I muſt tell him that this grant and acceptation will do him no ſervice.</p>
               <p>§. 71. For though it be true even in reſpect of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts and expreſſions of the inward ardency and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in prayer, that no law of God has interpoſed to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and neceſſitate the outward act of devotion either <hi>quoad ſpeciem</hi> or <hi>quoad exercitium,</hi> either for kind or degree, as that we ſhould uſe this geſture, ſuppoſe of ſtanding, kneeling or proſtration, &amp;c. this form of words, theſe lifting up the eyes, or hands to heaven, and the like, but has left us at liberty to uſe what we ſhall ſee fit in either kind, whenſoever we pray, yet ſince the law of God and religious prudence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, that <hi>all things be done decently and in order</hi> in Gods worſhip; it evidently follows, that whatſoever outward ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, or words, or ſigns, or expreſſions he ſhould make uſe of they were of neceſſity to be decent and fit, and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to the preſent <hi>ardency</hi> and inward <hi>devotion</hi> and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in prayer.

<pb n="633" facs="tcp:119243:338"/> he pleaſed, but onely ſuch as were prudentially fit and proportioned to the expreſſion of his inward ardency and devotion at this time; and upon this occaſion.

Nam ut recte dicit D. Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymus l.</hi> 2. <hi>contra Jovinian: ubi neceſsitas ibi nec corona; ideo liberi arbitrii condidit nos Deus.</hi> From hence in the third Section he proceeds to enquire how the will of Chriſt being altogether impeccable by virtue of the <hi>hypoſtaticall u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> could be poſſibly free and indetermined in its operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And then having propoſed the diſtinctions of liberty and indetermination and indifferency <hi>in ſenſu diviſo</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſito,</hi> and <hi>abſolutè &amp; ſimpliciter,</hi> and <hi>ex hypotheſi,</hi> and <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitione,</hi> and found them, as explained by ſome, not home to the ſolution of the queſtion, he propoſes diverſe other anſwers, and rejects them as inſufficient, and at laſt gives his own reſolution to this effect, that though ſince Chriſt were by virtue of the <hi>hypostaticall union</hi> impeccable, and therefore would infallibly perform whatſoever God had commanded him, yet this outward <hi>morall determination</hi> of the action by the <hi>precept</hi> would not at all hinder the naturall liberty of the will, but remain it would free as before, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing no ſuch command. And when he had explained and confirmed this aſſertion, he at laſt concludes, <hi>Sic igitur ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitus ſenſus diviſus &amp; compoſitus ſufficienter ſolvit difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem</hi>

Secundo ſuppono praeter amorem Dei beatificum eſſe potuiſſe in anima Chriſti alium amorem Dei: nam ſicut anima Chriſti duplici ſupernaturali ſcientiâ cognoſcebat Deum, beatâ &amp; infuſâ: ita potuit duplici actu amoris illum amare, ut infra q.</hi> 19. <hi>(diſp.</hi> 39. <hi>de merito Christi) latius dicam.

Ad hunc ergo modum intelligi poteſt, ita animam illam amaſſe Deum neceſſariò, ut amor ille ſiſteret in ſola formali conjunctione et unione ad Deum, ſuo modo ad formalem beatitudinem pertinente, &amp; non ſe extende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, nec communicaret (ut ita dicam) aliis operibus &amp; acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, qui in Chriſtum ut viatorem conveniebant.

Ex quo ulterius facile intelligitur ab illo amore libero, liberè etiam proceſſiſſe actus obedientiae, charitatis proximi &amp; aliarum virtutum, quas Chriſtus Dominus ut viator exercuit: tum quia ille amor est ſufficiens principium &amp; cauſa illorum, tum etiam quia amor beatificus, ut dictum eſt, veluti continebatur, ne influerit in hujuſmodi actus, ſed relinqueret voluntatem operari modo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodato Viatori. Et ita videtur fieri ſatis omnibus diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultatibus poſitis.</hi> This he further confirms and explains.</p>
               <p>§. 78. And now I appeal to the whole world, whether any thing could be ſaid more high and full to the Doctors poſition, and what we have delivered in the clearing and confirmation of it, and more contrary and deſtructive to the pretences of our <hi>Refuter</hi> in his ſecond argument, in every part and parcell of it. For firſt plain it is that <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi> here diſtinguiſhes Chriſts ſtate of <hi>Comprehenſor,</hi> from his ſtate of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iator.</hi> Secondly, he diſtinguiſhes the <hi>neceſſary acts</hi> of his <hi>Beatifick love</hi> from the <hi>free acts</hi> of his love ſpringing from the <hi>infuſed habit</hi> of charity. Thirdly he aſſerts that the <hi>Beatifick</hi> neceſſary love had no influence upon the <hi>infuſed</hi> love,
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:119243:341"/> and conſequently this might be moſt <hi>free</hi> and <hi>meritorious</hi> in the <hi>act</hi> and <hi>exerciſe,</hi> though the other were not. Fourthly that this <hi>free infuſed</hi> love was a ſufficient <hi>cauſe</hi> and <hi>principle</hi> of all the inferiour acts of obedience and piety and virtue, which as Chriſt in the ſtate of <hi>viator</hi> did freely exerciſe, ſo they did as freely iſſue from that free meritorious love, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, as their firſt ſpring and iſſue. And then laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it appears from the words, that theſe <hi>elicite acts</hi> of virtue, piety, obedience, and the like, are the <hi>exteriour acts</hi> of charity that <hi>Suarez</hi> here means, and not the <hi>outward ſenſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,</hi> as our <hi>Refuter</hi> ſuggeſts.</p>
               <p>§. 79. And therefore ſince he has been ſo extreamly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy in the quoting of <hi>Suarez, Aquinas</hi> and other <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> my adviſe for the future ſhall be to him, that he let the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> and <hi>Scholaſtick</hi> Divines alone, and content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf onely with the <hi>Practicall,</hi> wherein I hope he will be more happy.</p>
               <p>§. 80. Much more to our preſent purpoſe might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved out of the following queſtion Sect. 5. where he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines <hi>Quomodo Christus videns ſemper in verbo omnes actus ſuos eos liberè exercere potuerit,</hi> as alſo from his 39. diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <hi>de merito Christi,</hi> where he proves that Chriſt did me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, though not by his <hi>Beatifick</hi> and <hi>neceſſary love</hi> of God, yet by the <hi>elicite acts</hi> of the <hi>infuſed,</hi> as alſo by the <hi>elicite act</hi> of <hi>charity</hi> to his <hi>neighbour,</hi> and all other infuſed virtues and graces and the like. But becauſe we cited part of this diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion already, and our <hi>Refuters</hi> groſs miſtakes need not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conviction, I refer the ſtudious Reader to it, where he ſhall find ſome things worthy his peruſall.

               </p>
               <p>§. 6. <hi>As for the</hi> Scholaſticalneſs <hi>of your Paper,</hi> though you profeſs <hi>it were a very vain thing for you to ſay any thing of it,</hi> yet you are ſo <hi>vainly</hi> ſelf-conceited to <hi>appeal</hi> to the <hi>judgement</hi> of the <hi>Reader</hi> for it, and <hi>to that judgement of his,</hi> you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, <hi>you ſhall contentedly ſubmit your ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="641" facs="tcp:119243:343"/>
               <p> §. 7. But though I have nothing to rely on but the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>favourable</hi> conſtruction, yet ſince our <hi>Refuter</hi> has been pleaſed to <hi>appeal</hi> to his <hi>judgement</hi> for the <hi>Scholaſticalneſs</hi> of his diſcourſe, to that <hi>Judgement</hi> let him go. And if I have not made good my <hi>firſt undertaking,</hi> let him cenſure as <hi>ſeverely</hi> as he pleaſe, and if he pardon my other <hi>weakneſſes,</hi> let him not ſpare me for that.</p>
               <p>§. 8. And thus after this <hi>appeal</hi> he <hi>conceitedly</hi> tells the Doctor <hi>Your Refuter for the preſent takes his leave of you, hoping when your more pleaſing and profitable imployments ſhall permit, to hear further from you, in the mean time he ſhall reſt, your hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervant, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 9. <hi>Your Refuter!</hi> In good time Sir! But how long I beſeech you have you been called by that name? If it be a title of your <hi>own</hi> chooſing, I doubt not but the world will ſee, you are miſtaken, and that you had very little reaſon to take your leave of the Doctor with a challenge to a <hi>ſecond</hi> encounter. Sir, It is <hi>honour</hi> enough to ſuch a writer as your ſelf that you have fallen <hi>once</hi> under the Doctors <hi>fatall</hi> pen. And whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you <hi>jeeringly</hi> think of his <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid. D. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi>

                     </gap> §. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>more pleaſing and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble employments,</hi> yet well aſſured I am that wiſer Judges then your ſelf are perſwaded, that his <hi>time</hi> and <hi>abilities</hi> will be more uſefully employed, then in drawing of a <hi>ſawe</hi> with ſuch <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> as your ſelf; and therefore his <hi>friends</hi> did not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably adviſe</hi> him <hi>wholly to withdraw himſelf</hi> â foro con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſioſo <hi>to ſome more pleaſing and profitable employment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 10. And now Sir you may <hi>take your leave of the Doctor</hi> if you pleaſe, and <hi>reſt</hi> as long as you think fit. I ſhall not be ſo <hi>confident</hi> as you are, to ſend <hi>challenges,</hi> nor <hi>reſt for the preſent</hi> in expectation of <hi>new duels.</hi> Yet if you ſhall think fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn an anſwer, I ſhall not fail by Gods bleſſing to <hi>reply,</hi> but onely ſo far forth as <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> go with me. For it is not <hi>victory</hi> I contend for, but <hi>that.</hi> And ſuch is a worthy <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> contention indeed. For as there is nothing I love more
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:119243:344"/> then <hi>civility</hi> and <hi>clearneſs</hi> in diſputes, ſo me thinks, there is nothing ſo becoming a Chriſtian, as <hi>conviction,</hi> not <hi>calumny.</hi> Nor am I better pleaſed then when <hi>errors</hi> not <hi>perſons</hi> are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned and condemned, and <hi>reaſon</hi> not <hi>paſſion</hi> ſteers and guides the whole controverſie.</p>
               <p>§. 11. And if in ſome places I may ſeem not to have kept to this <hi>rule,</hi> it was becauſe I foreſaw I could not otherwiſe check your <hi>confidence,</hi> nor ſooner make the <hi>Peacock</hi> to veil and ſink his <hi>train</hi> then by bringing his <hi>eye</hi> to behold his <hi>black feet.</hi> If you had not all a long ſo <hi>undervalued and ſlighted</hi> your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary (whoſe worth and great parts, the world has long ſince admired) I ſhould not ſo much as have been <hi>angry</hi> with your <hi>errours,</hi> nor have been more <hi>diſpleaſed</hi> that you differed from me and the Doctor in <hi>judgement</hi> then in <hi>complexion</hi> and <hi>ſtature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 12. Perhaps you may be offended with this my <hi>plain dealing.</hi> For ſome perſons are of ſuch intemperate <hi>paſſions,</hi> that they can be angry with their <hi>glaſſes,</hi> and break them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they <hi>faithfully reflect</hi> and repreſent their <hi>deformities.</hi>
